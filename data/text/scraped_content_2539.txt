Title: Isolating yourself Content: When we hide our pain and isolate ourselves, we throw away the most powerful antidepressant: loving support from people who care about us.You don’t need coping strategies when you’re sad discouraged, or helpless. You need people. You need support. You need someone to give you a hug and listen carefully to your story.
Title: Keeping quiet Content: Most of us hesitate to push back and stand up for ourselves because we’re afraid of being perceived as aggressive or rude. And so we default to being passive.But there’s a middle road between being passive and aggressive: You can be assertive. It means standing up for your own wants, needs, and values, in an honest and respectful way.
Title: Talking trash to yourself Content: If you talked to other people the way you talked to yourself, you’d probably have zero friends, no job, and multiple warrants out for your arrest. Why treat yourself in a different way?
Title: Trying to manage stress Content: Stress management is a Band-Aid. It’s treating the symptoms.If you’re constantly stressed, the long-term solution is to fix the original cause of the stress (the stressor) not the feeling (the stress response).
