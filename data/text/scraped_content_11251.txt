Title: Why Zoom Calls Drain Us Content: Video calls require more focus than face-to-face chatting. We have to pay more attention to process the non-verbal cues like tone, pitch, body language and facial expressions. There is also a feeling of dissonance when the minds are together but the bodies are physically apart.One finds it harder to relax in a conversation, as even a slight delay (silence) makes us feel that the other person is not friendly or focused enough.
Title: Everything From A Tiny Screen Content: Video Calling is being used for studying, dating, talking to your parents and for work purposes, leading to a new kind of exhaustion of doing everything from your laptop or smartphone screen. Add to this our being confined in a tiny space (like a room) most of the time.
Title: Relaxing Activity Vs Performance Content: If video calling and catching up with friends was a relaxing activity, where you can just be yourself, you would not feel fatigued.What we have here is an added pressure to perform virtually among so many other participants, each vying for attention and validation.
Title: Reducing Zoom Fatigue Content: Try to limit video calls to those which are necessary.Turning on the camera should be optional, and not mandatory.Put the screen on the side, giving an illusion of being in an adjoining room.Share important information via email and file attachments, making video calls shorter.Make sure you stretch, do some exercise and keep yourself hydrated.
