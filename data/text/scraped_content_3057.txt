Title: Desire Content: We always work the hardest for the things we are most passionate about.Choose your destiny and invest yourself in those fields that most interest you.
Title: Don't become an expert at the familiar Content: This type of comfort breeds something lazy in us and we only do what is expected of us, but do not go beyond.Crave what is new and unexplored, and fearlessly pursue those areas.
Title: Choose to excel Content: Effort counts twice as much as genius or talent.Commit to being a person who wants to be more, do more, and consistently test the limits of your capacity. Embrace the responsibility and enjoy the freedom that comes with it.
Title: Be willing to be uncomfortable Content: Success does not come to those who wait for it. It comes to those who take action.Miracles come the moment we take the leap into the uncomfortable, positively coach ourselves through fears and uncertainties, and commit to staying in action until we achieve the goals we set out to accomplish.
Title: Listen to your heart Content: Our desires for success may encourage criticism from others.Give yourself the permission you need to go out and grab the life you want.
Title: Freedom Content: Freedom is the reward to come from our hard work. We will be able to enjoy the freedoms we were not able to experience while we were building and developing our careers.
Title: Leave your mark Content: The most significant way to leave our mark is to be of service to others. Give back, mentor, donate, be kind, inspire and help everyone who is willing to receive it and use it. Be mindful to keep a balance with proper boundaries.
Title: Be kind Content: Being kind should not equate to being a pushover.When we deeply respect who we are, we are not insecure and living in an unspoken competition with everyone we meet. We are open to others to see how we can contribute.
