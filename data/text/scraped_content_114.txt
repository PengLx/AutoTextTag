Title: Sleep deprivation Content: Willpower, memory, judgement, and attention all suffer when you are sleep deprived.You drop things, crave junk food sugar, overeat, gain weight. You’re more irritable, negative, emotionally reactive, forgetful and your ability to connect meaningfully to other people shuts down.
Title: Get through sleep deprivation: Content: Stabilize your blood sugar, by eating hearty food (protein and fat) more often.  Reduce refined carbs and increase fats and proteins.B-complex vitamin supplements can give you an immediate boost in alertness and mental clarity.  Soak in an Epsom salt bath - might even help you get enough energy to exercise the next day.Drink more water than you usually do to help compensate.  Exercise is the single best way to “take out the trash” in your body, and after staying up more hours than you should.
