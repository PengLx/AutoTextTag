Communication
Title: The Art of Communication Content: Talking to another person mindfully should be because you're wanting to "connect" with whomever you're speaking with from a place that is present, kind and respectful.We have the opportunity to engage with total awareness and recognize the "best of" each other by what we choose to say.
Title: Bring out the "best of yourself" Content: Make a conscious effort to bring out the best in someone else through your communication.This makes communicating less "me-centric," which is talking to hear yourself talk, or talking "at" someone rather than "with" them, or being more interested in wanting to "capture" their attention for some kind of pay off.
Title: Painting with words Content: Consider communication as an empty canvas to paint with words, think of all of the wonderful and beautiful things you can say to another person.It's helpful to know that what we say to someone else, might not be what we would want said to us.
