Title: Replace Self-Criticism Content: Our brains automatically look for evidence that matches up with what we believe about ourselves, but often disregards other evidence to the contrary.To break this automatic tendency, deliberately say something different to yourself and then actively search for evidence that the new statement is true. The more examples you come up with to support your alternate view, the less self-criticism will come around.
Title: Talk Back Content: Talking back to your inner critic is an important part of taking away its power.Telling the critic you don’t want to hear what it has to say begins to give you a sense of choice in the matter.
Title: Separate The Critic From You Content: Self-criticism isn’t innate to us, it’s internalized based on outside influences, such as other people’s criticism, expectations, or standards. It’s a habit that can be unlearned or controlled.One way to separate yourself from the self-criticism is to give it a name. Doing so, you better positioned to free yourself from its influence.
Title: Notice The Critic Content: Constantly slowing down and paying more attention to your thoughts will help you notice self-criticism. Negative emotions such as doubt, guilt, shame, and worthlessness are often signs of self-criticism.Once you are aware of the critical voice, you will be in a position to stand up to it.
