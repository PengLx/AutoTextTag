Title: We're (Mostly) Focused On Ourselves Content: People are spending only a small part of their time on judging you; your self-judgment is overwhelmingly larger.People who seem to be mean don’t usually do it intentionally. There are exceptions, but generally, the hurt you feel is a side-effect.Relationships are your job to maintain. Don’t wait to be invited to parties or for people to approach you.
Title: Explicit Social Behaviors Content: Most of the intentions behind our actions are hidden. If a person is feeling depressed or angry, usually the resulting behaviors distort their true feelings.By focusing on empathy you can usually break away these subversions and get to the heart of the issue faster.
Title: Our Feelings Are Not Explicit Content: Most of the time you feel something, nobody else knows about it. So don’t get angry when people aren’t responding to you.If you deceive your thoughts with your actions, don’t get angry when you fool people.
Title: Selfish Altruism Content: It happens when helping you directly or indirectly helps me. And our behavior is largely dictated by it.Start understanding the motives of people and appeal to them as if they were selfish. Don’t expect people to offer aid outside of selfish altruism, it isn’t impossible, but it isn’t likely.
Title: People Have Poor Memories Content: People are forgetful by nature (especially with information they don't find relatable), so don’t assume hostility or disinterest if something is forgotten.
Title: We Are All Emotional Beings Content: Don't assume everything is fine just because someone isn’t having a nervous breakdown.We all have our individual problems, angst, and upsets that are normally repressed.
Title: Suffering From Loneliness Content: We are social animals and we feel especially sensitive to any threats to becoming ostracized.So many people who seem to have it all suffer from periods of loneliness.
