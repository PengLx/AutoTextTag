Title: Pretend You're Advising a Friend Content: Think outside yourself a little and pretend like you're offering advice.The reasoning here is really simple: your short-term emotions get in the way of decisions, and that clouds your judgment. It's hard to break free of your emotions, but it helps to know they affect your choices.
Title: Limit The Information You Take In Content: We usually believe that the more information you have, the better decisions we can make. However, at some point, we cross a threshold where we have too much information. That's when we start to fill in gaps and add weight to information that doesn't matter.This makes decision making way more difficult.
Title: Reverse Your Assumptions Content: You're so prone to continue making the same kind of choices throughout your life that challenging yourself and doing the exact opposite is often the best way to get around this problem. The idea here is to confront your default behavior, step outside your comfort zone, and use your imagination to test some completely new ideas.
Title: The Mental Backflip Content: List all your assumptions about your subject.Reverse each assumption. Consider their opposites.Ask yourself how to accomplish each reversal.The end result is a new viewpoint you might not have considered otherwise.
