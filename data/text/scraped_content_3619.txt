Title: Living in the 21st century Content: Living in our time requires different skills, one of the most important of which isunlearning activities, skills and formerly productive (or wise) activities such that new learning can take place.
Title: Automatic behaviors Content: Habitual behaviors usually occur in chains of activities: an initial stimulus sets them off, and then a sequence of events occurs. Habit chains are set off by triggers, which are stimulus events that bring the habits to mind and reinforce their execution.Once a trigger sets a habit chain in motion, it is difficult to stop it: You either don't notice it is happening or it plays with your mind so you don't care.
Title: The shortcut to unlearning Content: 'Flood' the old action with the newly desired action or habit.Rather than focusing on the unlearning part, simply design the new action you would like to take its place.With this approach of flooding your old routine with newly designed actions, the process of new learning overwhelms and makes extinct the old actions you wanted to unlearn.
