Title: Your resume Content: Your resume in a job application is essentially the document that’s going to market you to potential employers.Companies are looking for a particular set of skills or qualifications. If those skills don’t jump out at them on your resume, you may be overlooked, even if you’re the best person for the job.
Title: The Headline Summary Content: Your resume should start with a "headline summary." It is a very brief summary of what you have to offer as a job candidate. It should be less than two sentences:It should advertise your abilities.Be broad enough that you can elaborate on them in the rest of the resume.Mention anything specific that you know the employer is looking for or any substantial life achievement relevant to the job that will make you stand out as a candidate.
Title: Work Experience Content: Describe your work experience in a series of lists. Lists are easier to view than written sentences.Describe how, in the past, your contributions in a company have led to marked improvements. Be relevant.Make sure you address all relevant gaps and time frames when you describe your work experience, for example, self-employment, or school or family obligations. It can be a big red flag for employers when they notice a significant gap in your employment history.
Title: Skills Content: Listing skills is not the same as listing your work experience. Your skills should be relevant to the job you're applying for.Look at the required skills listed in the job description so you'll have a good idea of what you need to list. List the most effective skills at the top.Focus more on the "hard skills" obtained in specific tasks, certifications, or knowledge that are relevant to the work.Soft skills, like "good with people" or "team player" will be listed in almost every resume.
Title: Education  Content: The education section is mostly put at the end of the resume unless your job is a professional job that requires a specific education.List the level of the degree, then the field of study, then the name and general information of the institution.List your highest degree of education first, then follow in descending order.Only list educational honors and achievements that are notably exceptional or associated with your graduation.
Title: Computers and Resume Keywords Content: If you're applying to a job online, make sure you stand out to the hiring staff and to the computer program that sorts applications.The "applicant tracking systems" scan your resume for qualifications, skills, experience and keywords. Ensure your resume is effectively formatted and easy to scan.
