Title: Your sleep cycles aren't optimized Content: Your sleep cycles are approximately 75 to 90 minutes each.Factors like stress levels and unstable blood sugar levels can throw off your sleep cycles regardless of how much time you spend in bed.Get more sunlight exposure in the morning to help decrease cortisol levels later in the evening.Eat a well-balanced diet to keep your blood sugar stable at night.
Title: You’re not moving enough Content: Don't mistake the occasional workout for living an active lifestyle.Standing up and doing 50 jumping jacks or bodyweight squats will instantly make you feel more energized.Set a timer on your phone to do two minutes of bodyweight exercises every 90 minutes.
Title: You're deficient in crucial nutrients Content: Magnesium is responsible for over 300 enzymatic processes that help keep you energized and healthy. Without magnesium, your body can't effectively do these processes and you will feel drained.Make sure to eat four to five servings of magnesium-rich foods like spinach, chard, pumpkin seeds and almonds every day or consider adding in a magnesium supplement.
Title: Drink more fluids Content: Cell dehydration can literally damage your DNA.Your cells, tissues, and organs are all operating in a water medium. The murkier that water starts to get, the more you start feeling symptoms of fatigue.Drink half of your body weight in ounces of water each day.A 150-pound person would make sure to get in 75 ounces, for example.
Title: Stress is getting the best of you Content: With chronically elevated stress, your elevated cortisol levels lead to a surge of glucose in order to facilitate the perceived “fight-or-flight” situation you’re living in.Spiking glucose inherently leads to crashes.Simple breathing exercises can switch off your sympathetic (fight-or-flight) nervous system within a few seconds.
