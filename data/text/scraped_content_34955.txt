Title: Daydreaming Is Not A Waste Of Time Content: Contrary to popular belief, daydreaming is actually an evolutionary trait specific to human beings which harnesses our creative power and enables us to function in an effective manner.Research shows that a creative distraction like daydreams loosens us form our never-ending stream of thoughts and provides possible solutions to our problems, while enhancing our sense of identity.
Title: The Daydreaming Network Content: Our brains have many regions, like the prefrontal cortex, medial temporal lobes and the parietal cortex cluster, allowing us to imagine and visualize complex scenarios and their possible outcomes inside our minds. This makes daydreaming a complex and rich phenomenon which we take for granted.
Title: Imagination Is A Superpower Content: We all have imagination at our disposal, a highly complex brain function(though we ignore it), that can take us backwards or forward in time, like a time machine. A comprehensive neuroimaging brain scan analysis shows that dementia patients do not have this brain function of active imagination, and are stuck in the present moment. Similar studies on patients with Alzheimerâ€™s disease showed that they cannot remember past and future events, and are not able to imagine things apart from not having access to their memory.
