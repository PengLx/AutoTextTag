By asking for help, you benefit from someone else’s perspectiveand give them the opportunity to help solve a problem.Just ensure that you ask someone whose opinion you trust and that has experience with similar situations.
Title: Change The Environment Content: Often, our blocks result from us getting stuck in an unwanted pattern of thought. It becomes a routine and eventually an unwanted rut.Changing your inner or outer environment disrupts our routines and can be incredibly effective at helping us broaden our perspective. Ultimately, it’ll help us see new solutions to old problems.
Title: Change The Channel Content: Blocks arise when we focus on what we don’t want, instead of what we do want.A good way to remove the block is to spend some time doing something completely unrelated to the problem you are working on.
Title: Seek Out Sweat Sessions Content: An effective way to get creative and circumvent blocks is to engage in high-intensity activities that ground you in the present. Anything that gets you into a different environment, preferably one with fresh air and nature, often does the trick.
