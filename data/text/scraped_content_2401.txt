Title: Perfectionism and to-do lists Content: To-do lists can help perfectionists move past our paralysis. They may find making a list to be a reassuring guide to their day.But there's also a risk: to-do lists can backfire if they become yet another report card we perfectionists use to evaluate ourselves too harshly.
Title: Break down projects Content: ... into manageable tasks.This way, you're armed with a set of concrete actions to take rather a vague cloud of high expectations.
Title: Define the next action Content: ... rather than all subsequent steps.Focusing only on the next action gives you permission to work on something even if you don’t have it all figured out—which is crucial to completing tasks that in the past have left you paralyzed.
Title: Set priorities  Content: ... by designating A, B, C, and F Tasks.A tasks: These are what you’ll give most of your time and energy to. Work on these during the time of day when you have the most energy and focus.B tasks: Leave these tasks for lower energy times of day or batch them together on a particular day later in the week.C tasks: These are tasks that you’ll want to give the least of your energy to.F tasks: Try to delegate or automate these tasks as much as possible.
Title: Set a realistic schedule Content: Assign your tasks a time limit to force yourself to not get lost in perfecting each and every detail. Often, perfectionists bite off more than we can chew — one consequence of not prioritizing.
Title: Focus on process goals Content: ... rather than outcome goals.We often become so focusedon the end result of a project that we don’t appreciate and enjoy (or ever really get started on) the process.The satisfaction of small wins keeps us intrinsically motivated.
