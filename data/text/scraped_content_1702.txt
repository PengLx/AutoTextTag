Title: Criticism can be positive Content: Knowing where you’re not meeting expectations and understanding the negative perceptions others have of you is the only way you’ll learn and grow as a professional.It is also important not to let every harsh word or critique break your confidence.
Title: How to approach and process any piece of criticism Content: Make two lists:Things they’re wrong about and things that they might be right about.Next time you get feedback, make three columns: 1.What they said, 2. what’s ‘wrong’ with the feedback and 3. what might be right.Look at column three, and ask yourself:If this feedback was 100% true, what would I need to do with it? If someone I knew received this feedback, what would I tell him or her to do?
