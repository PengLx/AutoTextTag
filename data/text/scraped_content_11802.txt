Title: How to treat your income Content: Whatever income you are earning right now should be treated like itâ€™s temporary.Treat your current income as if it might need to stretch for as long as possible. It doesn't mean you need to cut back on everything, but you might need to consider cutting some of your expenses so that you can put more money into savings.
Title: Saving versus spending Content: Saving money now is worth more than spending money later. This advice applies to any budget item that you could spend less on now. Even if it is a really great deal, remind yourself that cash in hand now is worth more than an unnecessary purchase.
