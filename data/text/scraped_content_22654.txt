Title: Ontology Content: This is a branch of philosophy that deals with the questions of being and identity.Ontological psychologists and social scientists start with examining our self in social, political, economical, cultural and psychological terms, knowing the base value, before any self-help advice can be dispensed out by them.
Title: Self-help vs Social science Content: Self-help literature, like information, exists as raw, uncurated, unexamined information, while social science is like knowledge, beginning with the aggregated data and the processes of thinking, developed and updated over time.
Title: Myopic points of view Content: Many best seller self-help books like the much-celebrated How To Win Friends And Influence People by Dale Carnegie, written way back in 1936 provide a personal view of influencing and persuading others, which has later been proved to be ineffective.This is because many of these books are detached from various social and economical facts, offering a myopic view of the world.
Title: The appeal of self-help Content: The packaging and tone of a self-help book help a lot towards its appeal to the general public, giving them a sense of personal control and a sense of excitement, making them take action.The real value of the self-help book may be to energize the reader to take action, and not simply following the instructions of the book to the tee.
