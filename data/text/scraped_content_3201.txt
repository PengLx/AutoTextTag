Title: The "One Thing" Content: We all have that 'One Thing' on our task list that is the most important thing on the list, that would be the most meaningful and yet we’re not doing it.It'sso meaningful and important that it brings up a ton of uncertainty for us, and causes us to avoid, run, distract, comfort, procrastinate.
Title: Create a space Content: Put aside all the messages, social media, distractions, smaller tasks, organizing and tidying.Instead, have a small space (even just 10-15 minutes) for this important task, and nothing else.
Title: Meditate on meaning & feelings Content: For just a minute, mindfully drop into your body and feel your fear, resistance, frustration, overwhelm. Let yourself feel it fully.Then let yourself feel the love you feel for those who you’ll be serving by doing this task. 
Title: Do the smallest next step Content: Translate your love into a small action and pick the smallest action you can take to get the ball rolling:If you have a paper to write, focus on writing a few paragraphs.If you have to do your taxes, just get your documents together.If you have to organize your house, just organize one drawer.
