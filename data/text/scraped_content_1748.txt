Title: Use the why lens Content: Great leaders only solve problems within their control. Ones connected to their biggest why. They ask:Is this our problem?Why should we solve this problem?What happens if we don’t?How would the solution contribute to accomplishing our most important goals?
Title: Problems as opportunities Content: Problems fuel great leaders, providing opportunities to learn and grow to the next level.The greater the problem, the hungrier they are for a solution. Leaders like Richard Branson, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates view problems as golden opportunities to disrupt the market and revolutionize the customer experience.
Title: Acknowledging the problem Content: Great leaders acknowledge there is a problem and demonstrate the severity of the problem and the benefit of the solution to stakeholders, partners, and shareholders.This way, the leader not only takes responsibility for making the problem transparent, but he or she also explores different dimensions of the problem, consequently benefiting from others’ ideas.
Title: Separating problems from people Content: Great leaders separate problems from people. They ask questions until they understand the issue.A clear understanding of a problem delivers two-thirds of the solution. By doing so, they can approach the situation fairly and find a suitable solution.
Title: Pointing fingers Content: Great leaders know that finger-pointing does not solve problems. It only adds new ones. Instead, a leader starts problem-solving by narrowing down the issue. When the problem has been addressed and potentially solved, they ask their team members what they learned from the experience and how they can improve vulnerable areas.
