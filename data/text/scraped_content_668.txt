Title: Simple rules Content: They are shortcut strategies that save time and effort by focusing our attention and simplifying the way we process information. The rules aren’t universal- they’re tailored to the particular situation and the person using them.We use simple rules to guide decision making every day.
Title: Boundary rules for better decisions Content: They guide the choice of what to do (and not do) without requiring a lot of time, analysis, or information.They work well for categorical choices, like a judge’s yes-or-no decision on a defendant’s bail, and decisions requiring many potential opportunities to be screened quickly.These rules also come in handy when time, convenience, and cost matter.
Title: Prioritizing rules for better decisions Content: They rank options to help decide which of multiple paths to pursue.They are especially powerful when applied to bottleneck activities - pinch-points in companies, where the number of opportunities swamps available resources, and prioritizing rules can ensure that these resources are deployed where they can have the greatest impact. 
Title: Stopping rules for better decisions Content: They help you learn when to reverse a decision.Stopping rules are particularly critical in situations when people tend to double down on a losing hand.
