Title: When Problems Come Content: We all experience days when we are trying to fight with the problem(s) at hand. We generally:Run away from the problem.Ignore the problem.Comfort ourselves with stimulants like drinking, smoking, binge-eating, watching TV or playing games.Complain and blame others for our problems.All of these work to an extent, but are limited in their effectiveness and only offer temporary relief.
Title: Mental Shift: See The Problem As An Experience Content: When in a problem, do not avoid it, and instead allow yourself to experience the problem fully.It is not an unpleasant thing to shun, but a profound experience.Just like nature has a constantly changing weather, each a different, beautiful experience, so are your problems.Instead of unleashing fear, shower love on the problem, the people and the world.Be silent and listen to your surroundings. Experience everything fully.Be at peace with your life experience.
