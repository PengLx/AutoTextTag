Title: Self Sabotaging is a form of Self harm Content: To stop sabotaging yourself, you must first recognize when you're getting in your own way. Some of the time, we're acutely and painfully aware of this-like when we find ourselves procrastinating before taking care of a (literal or figurative) mess, so that it becomes a bigger deal to clean up later. Or we impulsively buy a large bag of potato chips when we're trying to cut back on junk food.To stop sabotaging yourself, you need to figure out your patterns of behavior and then find creative ways to counteract them and form new habits. Here are some of the practical strategies I suggest in my book.When you reduce your mental clutter, you'll have more time and cognitive energy for correcting your thinking and behavioral biases.A paradox perfectionists face in trying to reduce self-sabotage is their tendency to have inflexible standards and be dismissive of incremental gains. They want to solve a problem completely, right now, and aren't motivated by solutions that improve a problem by, say, one, 10, or 20 percent-even if these solutions are almost effortless.
