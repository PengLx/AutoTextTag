Title: The so-called double-barreled question Content: When being asked a double-barreled question, you might find yourself in difficulty to provide an appropriate answer. The term designs the fact of asking two questions, while allowing only one answer. Which can be pretty misleading, as you do not know for sure which question will your answer be taken into account for.
Title: The specificity of double-barrelled questions Content: If you ask a question and then realize that it is in fact a double -barrelled one and, therefore, it puts the person who is supposed to answer in difficulty, try a tip in order to ease the task for the other: ask two clearer questions instead of one. You will most certainly get a more appropriate answer and feel less frustrated about its understanding.
Title: Ask clearer questions Content: When trying to get clear answers, you should consider asking clearer questions.In order for this to happen, pay major attention to how your question is being developed: not trying to influence the other's answer and having somebody double check the way the question was put might prove life-saving techniques in this particular case.
