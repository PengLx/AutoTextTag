Title: Detoxing ≠ juicing or cleansing Content: Juicing or cleansing practices** are techniques for detoxing. **There are dozens of different protocols you can follow to perform a detox, though not all are created equal when it comes to safety or efficacy, and they don't necessarily need to include juicing.
Title: Your body's detoxing systems Content: The effects of modern life — pollution, poor dietary choices, contaminants in our food and water, stress or a sedentary lifestyle — can compromise the body’s ability to effectively detox the way it’s supposed to. The result of this toxic internal “congestion” is that we gain weight, develop diseases and lose our natural energy and vitality.
Title: Tired or sick Content: While it’s normal to feel somewhat fatigued during the first few days of detox, most experience more energy and sleeping better once they’ve adjusted. Mostly, detoxing shouldn't make you feel tired or sick.Part of the reason for this is that your body is doing less work digesting, which means you’re getting the benefit of that saved energy.
Title: You won't be hungry all the time Content: Don't give up solid food during a detox, as this can imbalance your blood sugar levels and potentially disrupt your hormones. Do eat a diet that consists of mostly vegetables, lean protein sources, some fruits, raw nuts and seeds, and perhaps a minimal amount of gluten-free grains like rice or quinoa.Give your body a break from “offender” foods like alcohol, sugar, caffeine and dairy. Curb hunger on a detox with plenty of healthy fat, which is found in foods like avocado or coconut oil.
Title: Exercise during a detox Content: Continue with your regular exercise routine, provided you really listen to your body. Walking is detoxifying, as is burst training.Be sure to hydrate well after a workout — detoxing requires significant water consumption in order to flush out toxins.
