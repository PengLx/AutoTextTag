Title: Reduce impulse buying Content: Before purchasing non-essential items ask yourself:Can I live without this item?Based on my financial situation, can I afford it?Will I actually use it?Do I have space for it?How did I come across it in the first place? (Did I come across it after wandering into a gift shop out of boredom?)What is my emotional state in general today? (Calm? Stressed?)How do I feel about buying it? (Happy? Excited? Indifferent?)How long will this feeling last?
Title: Spending money mindfully Content: Leave the item for 24 hours. If you still want it and can afford it, then make the purchase.Don’t let “blowout sales” tempt you. Ask yourself if you would buy the item if it were full price.Check your bank balance first thing every morning. It will ensure that you are aware of how much money you have to spend.Spend in cash. Handing over cash makes you more conscious of what you're spending.Put a sticker to your credit card that states "Do you really need this?!"Change the environments that cause you to spend.
