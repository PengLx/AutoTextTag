Podcasts
Title: Podcasting: The origins Content: The origin of the word ‘podcast’ was in a 2004 column in The Guardian by Ben Hammersley. He made up a sentence mentioning podcasting while delving into a possible name for the new audio distribution technology. It was a mashup of the Apple iPod, which was the in thing at that time,  and broadcasting.
Title: Audio blogs Content: Essentially audio blogs, taking advantage of the freedom of speech, early podcasts were chatty, amateur products, until some heavyweights joined the bandwagon, like MTV VJs, journalists and talk-radio personalities.This was fueled by the fact that the old public radio medium had certain creative limitations along with rules and regulations that were not a problem in the world of podcasting.
Title: Experiments in broadcasting Content: Podcasting started evolving with certain progressive companies like Stitcher along with early sponsors playing to a crude, uneven audience.Podcasting kept growing slowly, even during the 2008/09 recession, which was ironically a creative peak for the medium.Many new shows launched and things eventually reached a plateau in 2010/11.
Title: Podcasts and pop culture phenomena Content: A podcast by This American Life, called Serial became a pop culture phenomenon in 2014 and provided a ‘breakout’ moment for the medium, which had already gained a sticky audience over the years. This resulted in many new podcasts from established media houses and amateur creators starting to pop up.Ad revenue of podcasts has steadily increased, and a 2021 projection puts it at $1 Billion.
