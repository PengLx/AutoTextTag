Title: "Zombie" Content: The word comes from the Hatian folklore and refers to acorpse animated by witchcraft.In philosophy, this idea ofa regular human but with no conscious experiences is known as a “philosophical zombie" or a “p-zombie". It is an argument against physicalism -the school of thought that everything that makes us human is ultimately derived from our physical characteristics.
Title: P-zombie as a Foundation to Dualism Content: If a p-zombie is logically conceivable, a physical body minus the mental, then this possibility could support dualism -an alternative view that sees the world consisting of not just the physical but also the mental.

In other words, since a world of zombies is imaginable, all behaving purely at the physical level, why did evolution produce consciousness in humans?
Title: The Physicalism Analogy: A Proof to Dualism Content: Physicalism says that everything in our world is physical.If physicalism is true, everything in out world is physical including consciousness.But we can conceive of a “zombie world", a physical world without consciousness then,Physicalism is proven false, because our world consists of both physical and mental attributes.The existence of consciousness is a further, nonphysical fact about our world.
