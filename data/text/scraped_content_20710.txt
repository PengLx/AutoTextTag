Title: Moving Away From Pseudo-Work Content: Pseudo-work is when one works just for the sake of work, and is productive on paper but hasn’t really achieved anything substantial, or contributed to one’s core objective. We all have a certain idea of what we want to attain for ourselves.  In order to achieve it, we need to move towards essential, meaningful and productive work.
Title: Focusing on Meaningful Work Content: When the focus is on the essential, we start to work on what matters to us the most. It makes us avoid the urgent work shoved in our faces which may not be important at all.Focusing on meaningful work helps us prioritize our day in the order that aligns with our purpose and mission. It makes us less stressed out and more joyful.Productive work, which is challenging and even discomforting is welcomed as it is important and meaningful to our lives. The distractions then no longer disturb us as we are giving the work our entire focus.
Title: Keys To Essential Meaningful Productivity Content: Be clear on what matters to you, and focus on that. A lack of structure makes the entire day random and accidental. It is good to have a certain structure for all your tasks while keeping it flexible.Remind yourself the reason for it being important to you, and then give it your heart and soul. Keep yourself in a playful, relaxed mode. Move towards any fear you encounter, and not away from it. It may be a small obstacle but our psychological fears make us feel discomfort or groundlessness. Batch out small errands into specific, time-bound activities, leaving time for more important things.
