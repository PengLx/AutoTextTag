Title: Commit Content: Gratitude doesn’t seem to come as easily as grumbling does, and you will likely resist this exercise. Waiting for the resistance to pass is futile. Just do it.
Title: Begin Content: Sit down withpen and paper or at your computer and start, “I am grateful for …”Your gratitude list is a bridge across those troubled waters to a resting place on the other side.
Title: Practice present-moment gratitude Content: As you move through your day, pause now and then when you remember and think as you do something “I am grateful.”Moving through your day with awareness and grace in this way will mean that when you do sit down to write your gratitude list those things will come to mind.
Title: Share the gratitude Content: Partner with someone. You will keep each other going and that sense of obligation to that person will give you the push you need to write your list on those days when it just seems too hard.Reading what the other person has written helps you to access your own gratitude more easily.
