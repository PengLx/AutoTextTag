Title: Your Clothing and Accessories Content: When running in the wintertime:Wear long-sleeve tees or light jacket, and gloves.Take care of your clothing layers so that you can sweat without it bothering you in the cold.Wear MicroSpikes if there is snow.Carry a water bottle, one that doesn't leak.
Title: Optimize Your Route Content: If you choose to run during winter:Avoid high-snow areas or routes with parallel streets, as it can expose you to sudden cold.Avoid areas with street puddles, and do not run near the transit route of buses, which can splash you with cold water suddenly.Try to run when there is sufficient daylight. This helps avoid any tripping or falling.If it is snowing, avoid large puddles and slippery surfaces.
