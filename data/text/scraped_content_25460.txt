Title: Choose your hobbies wisely Content: Picking the right activities will prevent the clutter that comes from abandoned hobbies.Explore interests that provide a sense of flow - a highly focused mental state. Seek a combination of solitary and social hobbies that will develop a range of cognitive, creative, and physical skills.
Title: Set specific goals for your leisure activities Content: Your goal could be to master a piece of music on guitar or make a chocolate souffl√©.  We are more likely to stick with a hobby when the results are satisfying.
Title: Add recreation to your calendar Content: Chores and errands become more bearable when we have scheduled leisure time into the day.A specific time for a yoga class or art journaling can brighten an entire day.
Title: Invest time before money Content: If shopping for an outfit excites you more than the activity, it is probably not the right hobby for you.Explore new interests with borrowed, rented, or secondhand supplies. It seldom makes sense to invest in new gear before you have made a long-term commitment to your hobby.
Title: Your hobby should relax you Content: Recreation should not cause unnecessary stress.Setting boundaries for your time, materials, and budget will increase creativity and focus.
Title: Donate and share materials Content: Share durable supplies that you only use occasionally, such as woodworking tools.Admit when you've outgrown a hobby. Donate or sell excess gear that may otherwise create clutter.
