Title: Habits and success Content: Habits change your life, but they don't guarantee success.Waking up early, working hard, and taking cold showers do not cause success. They contribute to it, but they may be insufficient.
Title: Decide what habits are worth it Content: It's up to you to define what a good habit is.Thiscritical to forming new habits.To find your why, your reason to change, just ask yourself this: “Will habit x improve the quality of my life?”Answer that. And then, adopt habits that bring you closer to the things you want in life.
Title: Focus on one habit at a time Content: We overestimate ourselves most of the time. And that's one of the reasons we try to do so many things at the same time, in a short period.We can achieve a lot over a long period. So focus on one thing at a time. Stack one habit on top of the other, one by one.
Title: Set the bar very low Content: Focus on small things. Build a strong foundation. Without it, we can never achieve anything meaningful:Want to run daily? Start by walking.Want to write a book? Write once sentence.Want to start a business? Get one client.Want to read two books a week? Read one page a day.
Title: Use checklists Content: When you want to do something, you start doing it and then you forget about it.We must use checklists to remind ourselves of what we’re trying to achieve.Check off your habits daily. One day, you’ll be surprised by how much your life changed by such, seemingly, small habits.
