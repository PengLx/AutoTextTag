Title: Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviours (BFRBs) Content: Humans have anxiety-related behaviours like chewing on nails, or stressing any part of their body, which are repetitive and habitual.A new study shows that an increase in stress provides a surge in habitual behaviours, as they demand the least cognitive effort.
Title: Habit Memory: Strict Discipline May Not Be Good Content: Our habit memories are mostly rigid and inflexible, so it can be a challenge when the changing environment and circumstances require a corresponding alteration in behaviour.If a person is strictly adhering to their personal routines and habits, change can come as a shock, and also lead to many mental health issues like eating disorders, depression and anxiety disorders.
