Title: Group Development Theory Content: Dr. Bruce Tuckman, a psychology professor, synthesized team development into four basic stages:Forming, Storming, Norming, and Performing.
Title: Forming Content: This stageof teamwork is all about first meetings and first impressions.What everyone needs most is a clear understanding of their part in the journey and a setup forbuilding emotional connections. Setting goals together puts their skills and interests into the open.
Title: Storming Content: Most teams go through the storming stage in some form or another becausediscord is inevitable. The key value to emphasize in the team is positive intent.A little conflict is needed to bring upfront weak spots in projects and to bring new valid arguments to the table. But constant storming leads to the destruction of productivity, projects, and ultimately, the team itself.
Title: Norming Content: Getting to the Norming stage takes a healthy dose of observation, identification, and action on things that are working (and not working).Teams that stay in Norming are constantly working out things like communication preferences, recognition of achievements, and workflows.
Title: Performing Content: This is the stagewhen the synergy comes in:Group norms have been accepted, and people feel comfortable to exchange ideas, without fear of misplaced judgment or rejection.Team members have a clear understanding of where they can best serve the teamâ€™s needs, and everyone is highly motivated to get to the same goal.Team members are interdependent, meaning they need little managing.
