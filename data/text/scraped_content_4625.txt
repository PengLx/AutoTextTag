Title: The Forgetting Curve Content: Our memories have a 'forgetting curve', and unless we review what we see or learn, most of the content is forgotten in 24 hours, and the rest in the following days.Due to the Internet, our recall memory has become less necessary, because now we don't need to remember information to recall it.Recognition memory is more important with recall memory fading away due to it being 'externalized'.
Title: Memories Are Associations Content: The more information that is available to us, the more we are unable to retain it.Memory means association and most information we consume may be simply buried inside, lurking deep in, and surfacing when the right cue pops up.Binge-watching or binge-reading serves no useful purpose as we are only holding the content in our working memories. That's why schools space out the chapters and review them, helping us retain the material.
Title: Memories Get Interwoven Content: The art and culture we engage our brains in turn into memories which can be unpredictable and fickle.The books we read, the songs we hear and the movies we watch become interwoven and entangled with everything else in our lives.
