Title: Spend Just Five Minutes Writing Email Content: Email is important but can suck the productivity out of a day if it takes too long. The Five-Minute Rule helps us spend less time on email each day, soaring our productivity.One need not write those one-word emails (like some bosses do) to imply how busy and powerful they are, but can simply time themselves so that communication does not take more than 30 seconds per email.
Title: The Five-Minute Rule Content: Text expanders that expand your abbreviation into a text or phrase(like turning thx into thanks). These are available as separate apps and are also found on Gmail and Outlook.Using word count tools helps us avoid wordy emails, and there are many Chrome extensions available for the same.Use other collaborative tools like Calendar or Google Docs that have specific tools which are far beyond email.Example: Reviewing and commenting on a freelancer's work in Google Docs and then writing a 30 second email to inform.
