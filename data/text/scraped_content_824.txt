Title: Choice minimalism Content: Simplify the wardrobe. We tend to wear the same 10–20% of our wardrobes for 80%+ of the time. Eat the same few meals. Design a morning routine and save your willpower for important decisions later in the day.Shop the periphery. The unhealthy stuff is built into the center, so stay on outskirts: there are fewer options AND it’s healthier.Set “key objectives” before bed to saves time in the morning when you want to jump right into doing focused work.
Title: Do a self-diagnostic Content: Track decisions. Spend a week tracking all the choices you make in a day.Evaluate effectiveness. Review your notes and group decisions by category. Then ask, “Does this decision affect my desired outcomes?” Many of them won’t.Do a Pareto analysis. Ask, “What are the 20% or fewer useless decisions that are taking up 80% or more of my time?” Those are the ones to tackle first.
