Title: Burnout is related to what we can't control Content: Burnout, the condition when work makes us mentally, emotionally and physically drained, is not necessarily due to working long, stressful hours.Burnout is not an issue with people working on their own startup or doing things they love, as they are not dancing to the tune of the deadlines imposed by others, but doing what they want to do, for themselves. Burnout happens when things are not in our control.
Title: Imposter syndrome Content: The Imposter syndrome is when a person has a nagging feeling that he or she is not capable or suitable for the job role, and is not as smart or talented as assumed by his or her peers and bosses.It morphs into the anxiety of being ‘caught’ and the person ends up pushing hard to prove themselves to others, leading to burnout.
Title: Boreout and the monotonous work we do Content: Boreout results from the sameness, and the monotonous routine of the job, making the worker feel empty, mentally exhausted, sad and demotivated.Though it is okay to be bored once in a while, the continuous feeling or irritation, cynicism and worthlessness can lead to depression.
Title: Burnout vs boreout Content: Burnout happens when you are overstimulated, and boreout when you are understimulated. In both cases, the way we are stimulated is wrong and doesn’t result in a sense of purpose.
Title: Recreating meaning at work Content: Alignment: See if the work you do is aligned with your goals and values.Brainstorm: Sit with a friend or a trusted peer at the office to come up with solutions to find meaning and purpose at work.Experiment: Start with small changes, and if possible talk to a counsellor if you are feeling burned out or bored out.
