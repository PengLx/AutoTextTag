Title: Isaac Newton's productivity Content: In 1665 Isaac Newton, a young scholar of Trinity College, fled from the Bubonic plague to his home, about sixty miles from the university. While in solitude, he would invent calculus, create the science of motion, unravel gravity, an more. The plague created the conditions in which modern science could be created. Or at least, that is the inspirational story that is being touted as a model. 
Title: Newton's brilliance Content: The idea that the plague woke the brilliance in Newton is wrong and misleading as a measure of how well we apply ourselves during our own plague spring.Isaac Newton had begun to think about the most pressing questions in science in 1664, a  year before the plague broke out. Similarly, when the epidemic finally burned itself out in 1666, Newton kept on doing the same kind of work when he returned to Trinity College. Retreating to the country itself was not the decisive reason for his inventions.
Title: Keep stoking your passion Content: Doing the work was what mattered to Isaac Newton. He kept at it before the plague, during, and after his return to college.  He wrote that during the plague year, he had been in the prime of his age for invention and minded Mathematics and Philosophy more than at any time since.Newton was able to do what he did not because of the forced solitude, but because of who he was. You should use this time of solitude, not to emulate an impossible standard, but to keep going at whatever aspect of your life that fires your passion.
