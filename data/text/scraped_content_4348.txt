Title: Protection By Face Masks Content: Due to the Wuhan virus spreading across the world, the use of face masks might seem a good means of protection.The N95 mask, which is a heavy-duty mask offers better protection (95% of airborne particles are blocked) but is uncomfortable to be worn for long periods as it gets difficult to breathe.The more common and disposable surgical masks are comfortable to wear and are more easily available than the N95 ones, but offer meagre protection, especially against airborne pathogens.
Title: Protect Yourself Wisely Content: Cloth masks, which are reusable and washable, offer no real protection while being potentially harmful in case there is any moisture retention or dirt in them due to their being reused.It is a good practice to wear a mask all the time, especially if you have any respiratory illness.It is advisable to be careful while removing your mask, as a mere touch of your hands on the front of the mask can contaminate it.It is also advisable not to touch your face or nose too much.Constantly and frequently wash your hands, all year round, and get a flu shot, as it is flu season. While a flu shot is not a protection against the virus, it is still advisable to get one.
