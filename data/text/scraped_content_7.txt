Title: Productivity is a deeply personal thing Content: We all have different brains and, therefore, different preferences, perspectives, and situations where we feel most effective. In order to find what works, you have to understand your own psychology.
Title: Action has momentum Content: So developing personal rituals to get your own snowball rolling downhill is far more important than what yerba mate supplements to take, or what yoga mat to sit on in the morning.
Title: Work as a linear function Content: We assume that the amount of productive output we create is directly proportional to the number of hours we input. But the truth is that most thoughtful, brain-intensive work does not unfold like this. The only work that is linear is really basic, repetitive stuff.
Title: Your brain tires out Content: If you’re exercising your brain by doing any sort of problem-solving, or important decision-making, then you’re limited in how much you can effectively accomplish in a day.
Title: Finding the leverage point Content: Accomplishing some aspects of your job well can make everything else that much easier or that much harder.Every job has a leverage point that makes everything else you do more effective.
Title: Importance of free time Content: Leisure time makes your brain far more effective upon returning to work.Weekends and vacations really do exist for a reason.
