Title: Making Your Budget Too Strict Content: Budget for the life you have. When you’re going through your budget and assigning spending categories, be realistic.Don’t tell yourself you’ll never buy a single discretionary item, because you’re setting yourself up for failure. Give yourself some breathing room.
Title: Budgeting for a Life You Can’t Afford Content: This becomes a problem when you’re spending for a life you can’t afford. It puts pressure on your budget and encourages you to live in a paycheck to paycheck cycle.Assess your financial situation, cut back on your expenses, prioritize your money goals, and then come up with a new spending plan.
Title: Budgeting Without a Purpose Content: It’s hard to stick to a budget that doesn’t have a goal.When there isn’t one, your budget becomes an afterthought rather than a spending plan to reach your financial goals.
Title: Forgetting About Irregular Expenses Content: If you keep blowing your budget because expenses “pop up” every month, you’re probably not budgeting for irregular expenses.It’s a common budget problem with an easy fix: find those quarterly, annual, and other seemingly random expenses, and add them in.
Title: Not Having a Cushion Content: It’s important to have an emergency fund. When your car breaks down, you have money to pull from, rather than screwing up your budget for the next few months until you get back on track.It might take you some time and slow down your goal progress, but building an emergency fund will keep you from blowing your budget.
