Title: Prepare for Difficult Situations Content: Creating a small chunk of time to mentally gear-up for difficult situations is a proactive step in the right direction. Writing your thoughts down can be helpful. Make a list of the questions you’d like to ask, the information you need to give, and the answers you’ll likely have to provide.
Title: Frontloading Content: This is the opposite of procrastinating. To frontload a project, set up a schedule that forces you to do the bulk of your work within the first 50% of the time you have allotted for the project.It gives you the chance to eliminate stress by finishing your task ahead of schedule.
Title: Focus on Communication Content: A lot of productivity is lost each day through miscommunication or non-communication.If it’s your responsibility to reach out to someone, don’t delay and don’t distract from the main point. A quick phone call, a concise email, or even a properly-placed sticky note can all achieve the same goal: proactive communication.If someone else is doing the talking, make sure you are listening well.
