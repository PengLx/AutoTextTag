Title: Storytelling Is Everything Content: Whether it's telling inspiring stories to customers or delivering a presentation to executives and the board of directors, being a good storyteller helps us make the leap from Good to Great. Product managers and designers can benefit tremendously by great storytelling, and so can anyone who is working with product design.
Title: Purpose Content: Instead of selling products, we need to focus on their purpose and what good it does for the end-user. Focus on the need of the customer and design the product around it.
Title: Care Content: We empathize and admire the underdog, someone who struggles while facing difficult circumstances.When we care for the end-user, getting to know their struggle, we can go the extra mile to help them.
Title: Rooting For Success Content: If customer success is our end goal, we need to focus on how this is achieved, even with tough likelihoods.You need to root for the 'hero' to succeed, developing a connection and cheering along.
Title: Credibility Content: We lose our audience when our stories lack credibility and believability, as we lose touch with the end-users objective and their journey. Keeping things believable and honest makes people care.
Title: Tell-Show-Tell Content: The Tell-Show-Tell Structure:Tell the audience what's about to unfold, and what the user needs.Show them how it happens.Tell them why they need to care and what's at stake.The story also needs to be innovative and fresh, though it may revolve around the tried and tested hero's journey narrative.
Title: The End Content: Know well in advance what the ending would be like. The purpose and key result should be the final outcome. Make sure your focus does not deviate from the main objectives.
