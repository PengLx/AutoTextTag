Title: Improve Your Resume Content: Most people use powerful action-oriented verbs, and short sentences highlighting their accomplishments in their resumes and LinkedIn profiles.Bullet points and buzzwords do not ring a bell with the recruiter anymore.
Title: Storify Your Resume Content: Instead of spilling words with no head or tell, try to incorporate compelling before-and-after stories in your resume.Your Hero's Journey can include your earlier companies (when you were a fresher), the challenges you faced and how you overcame them. You can add how the organizations are better because of you and can elaborate when needed, using bullet points.
Title: Compelling Tales Of You Content: Hiring managers and recruiters will be reading your stories about your accomplishments in a story format, instead of a bulletin board. They will see what you have done (and how) and what you can do for them. You can sell your skills by writing a compelling story, preferably non-fiction.
Title: LinkedIn Stories Content: Even your LinkedIn profile can be storified, adding pizzazz, flesh and blood in the cold words. Writing in the first person immediately grabs the reader's attention while ending with giving out a helping hand makes the reader want to contact the candidate.
