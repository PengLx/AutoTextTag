Title: Waiting patiently Content: Patience is not the ability to wait for something.Patience is our attitude towards waiting.And the truth is we are becoming more and more impatient, mostly because we are now used to have everythingat our fingertips, 24/7.
Title: Learn to be still Content: Block out time to be still. Finding moments of stillness in our lives increases creativity, makes us more productive and also helps us stay grounded in our emotions.
Title: Understand your impatience Content: Impatience could be linked to a deeply-rooted sense of entitlement. Because in reality, we don’t know what’s going on with other people.Maybe the pizza guy got in a car accident. Maybe your partner didn’t sleep last night because they’re so anxious about an important work meeting.
Title: The real value of time Content: Waiting meansexperiencing a certain period of time without any reward. And we have to truly understand the kind of rewards we are seeking: internal or external.The true rewards in life are the ones that bring us the most meaning. And internal ones make it easier for us to spend time inour own thoughts and enjoying the fact of simply being.
