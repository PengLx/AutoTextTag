Title: Contagious yawning Content: Whenever someone yawns near you, you may find it near impossible not to yawn.New studies found the reason we battle to stop a yawn appears to reside in the brain area that's responsible for motor function. The urge to yawn when you see someone else doing it is known as echophenomenon - the automatic imitation of another person. Other types of echophenomena include echolalia - imitation of words, and echopraxia - imitations of actions.
Title: Yawning and brain activity Content: The urge to yawn increases when you try to stop yourself from doing so. The tendency to yawn in return is linked to brain activity levels in a person's motor cortex. The more activity in the area, the more likely the person would be to yawn.
