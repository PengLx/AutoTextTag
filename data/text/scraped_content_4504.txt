Title: The 2 Models of Human Development Content: The 'Surrender Yourself' model dials up your levels of happiness as you progress from your basic needs (like food and good health) towards your achievements like recognized success, or creative expression. The pinnacle of this human development model is complete surrender.The 'Fully Human' model is a more subjective way of helping you find your own path. When our most important needs like food, shelter, safety, and stability are met, followed by our need to love, belong and connect with others, we then pursue mastery.
Title: Self-Actualization Content: It implies acknowledging and respecting the sacredness and uniqueness of each kind of person.Self-Actualization also necessitates full access to information, full knowledge of the truth, and being able to choose without fear or social pressure.The one thing left out of this theory is social psychology, as all the needs of a human being cannot be understood in isolation and social conditions are also necessary for personal growth.
Title: Self-Transcendence Content: It involves advancing a cause greater and beyond the self, experiencing a drastic shift in perspective, beyond the confines of the self through the highest level of experience.Self-transcenders have a completely selfless value system and are leaning towards serving humanity, with an eventual goal of transcending their ego.
Title: Healthy Selfishness Content: It happens when one is indulging in self-care without any damage to others. It leads to growth, meaning, and purpose in life, including positive social relationships.Pathological altruism, on the other hand, is trying to give or help others in ways that may cause harm to yourself or others.
Title: Romantic Relationships Content: Romantic relationships have the extraordinary potential to expand our selves.They create a 'role engulfment' where one's identity is based entirely on one specific role of being a good lover/partner. It is conducive to one's growth and health and eventually applies to the self, and one starts to help others selflessly.
