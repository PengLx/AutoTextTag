Love & Relationships,Personal Development
Title: Knowledge Content: When forming deep, intimate relationships, we share a vast amount of personal information that we wouldn't necessarily feel comfortable sharing with others.We feel safe sharingour deepest dreams, desires, fears, past histories, traumas, and goals for the future. Generally, this is a reciprocal and gradual process.
Title: Interdependence Content: Intimate relationships also tend to be highly interdependent, whereineach partner influences the othermeaningfully, frequently, and vastly, in terms of topic and importance.
Title: Care Content: While the display of care can differ from one person to the next (as a function of communication styleor differing displays of affection, for instance), intimate partners tend to display genuine, selfless care for each other.
Title: Trust Content: Trust is the confidence that we place in another human being to act in a way of honor andfairnessthat is of benefit to us, or at the very least,that our partner will not cause us purposeful harm.
Title: Responsiveness Content: Healthy intimate relationships involvepartners who are mutuallyresponsive to each other'sneeds. This meansrecognizing, understanding, and supporting each other, both in times of pain (e.g., losing a parentor a job) and gain (e.g., getting a promotion, announcing a pregnancy).
Title: Mutuality Content: After a certain point within a healthy intimate relationship, each partner recognizes a close connection and changes his or her view from "me"to "we."
Title: Commitment Content: There is a mutual choice for wantingthe relationship to continue indefinitely.It allows for trust to continue to deepen, common knowledge to further be shared, mutuality to envelop, care to be shown,and continual effort be put into responsiveness and interdependencefor both partners.
