Title: Managing  your emergency fund Content: Having an emergency fund can prove life-saving when you are in desperate need of money. However, before starting to use the money, make sure the situation really requires the measure.For instance, try spending the money on situations that occur totally unexpectedly rather than on events that happen on a regular basis.
Title: Evaluating necessity Content: One very important reason, if not the most important of them all, when choosing to use your emergency fund, is the situation of necessity.Of course, if you have to, you should do it. However, you might want to pay attention to what necessity really means: if you can as well do without, then you probably should not spend your savings on that.
Title: Patiently manage your emergency fund Content: Whenever you have the impression that you should use your emergency fund, ask yourself if the situation really is urgent. If the answer is Yes, there is no time to waste.However, take time and be patient in managing different situations as, if there is no need to spend the money, than better not do it. Remember, it took time to build up that fund, no matter how big or small it eventually is.
