Title: Emotions: A Primer Content: Basic emotions like anger, surprise, disgust, joy, fear and sadness are thought to be universal, and a naturally-occuring reflexive response to a given situation, event or circumstance.New studies show that human emotions are far more nuanced, and just like primary colors produce thousands more, our emotions are subjective, diverse and as many as all the possible human experiences.
Title: Kinds Of Emotions Content: In Psychology, emotions can be either the result of an experience of a situation, or a certain perception of changes that occur within our bodies.  There are higher emotions like self-awareness, self-consciousness, and an increased sense of empathy or compassion for others. Moral emotions include pride, guilt, shame and embarrassment.
Title: Reasons We Experience Emotions Content: Emotions are a basic response to change, both internal and external, sometimes simultaneously. While our mood lasts for hours or even days, emotions are fleeting, like waves.Emotions are a spontaneous, motivating agent of change, making us act in our most natural, human way, before the mind comes in the picture, which looks at other signals before reacting.
Title: The Good Side Of Having Emotions Content: Emotions help us stay on our path, and also maintain our social bonds. They serve as social signals to others, as the basic emotions are visible on our faces, at least for the majority of us.Emotions also act as gatekeepers (guilt and shame, for example) that signal us regarding our behaviour and if a line has been crossed.
