Title: The snowball debt method Content: With this method, you pay off your debts from the smallest balance to the largest balance, regardless of interest rates.When you pay the smallest debts first, you start to clear your low debts away very quickly. Doing this feels empowering. Once you've paid off a debt, you will have more money to send as an additional payment to the next debt you are focused on (hence the snowball analogy.)
Title: The avalanche debt method Content: In the debt avalanche method, you pay your debts from the highest interest rate to the lowest interest rate, regardless of balance.You will pay less in interest if you pay off your debts in this order. You will also pay it off faster.
Title: Deciding between the Snowball and Avalanche debt methods Content: The supporters of the two methods are both enthusiastic about which one to use. However, it barely matters which system you use. The best approach is the one that keeps you motivated.Make the minimum payments on all of your debt. Then, focus on one debt that bothers you the most and put every dollar you can towards it until it is gone. Then move on to the next debt.
