Title: Exercise and our food choices Content: Taking up exercise could change your desire for specific foods. One study found that novice exercisers start to have a diminished appetite for fattening foods. However, different people respond differently to the same exercise routine and the same foods, showing the complexities of the relationship between exercise, eating, and fat loss.

Others will gain, and most will drop a few pounds.Studies show that most types of exercise increase appetite in most people, tempting us to replace calories and preventing potential fat loss.Other evidence suggests that physical fitness may affect people's everyday responses to food.
