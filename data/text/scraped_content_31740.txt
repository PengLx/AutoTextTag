Title: Small Habits, Big Changes Content: Many of us work towards having better habits, using goal setting and new year resolutions to try and change ourselves, only to fail miserably. A study showed that 92 per cent of new year resolutions fail, most of it by February.The problem may be our favouring big goals and to aim big, only to fail spectacularly. Small changes or micro-steps can be a failsafe measure toward big changes.
Title: Micro-steps For Big Gains Content: Turn off your devices a few hours before sleeping.Set an ‘it’s bedtime’ alarm to remind yourself.Eat with mindfulness, in a seated and relaxed manner.Walk around instead of sitting during a meeting, for more creative output.Turn off all notifications except the crucial contacts.Reduce all time-sucking distractions from your smartphone and make it a tool instead of a toy.Leave time aside to be intentionally bored, instead of fiddling with your device.Answer email in blocks of time and not 24/7.Set aside time to write about your worries and concerns.Be comfortable with having unfinished work at the end of the day.
