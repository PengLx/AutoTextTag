Title: Long-term flexible commitment Content: What many people fail at with long-term commitments is that they make their initial vision too rigid. Flexible commitment can help overcome this by bringing together two properties. Flexibility to change the terms of your goal as information becomes available allowing you to redirect efforts and commitment to the core effort so as to not abandon your goal entirely.
Title: Walk the Winding Path Content: Stick to short commitments. Get good at this skill before going further.Understand your goal at different levels. The highest goal should be fairly abstract.Set a much more specific agenda of how I could fulfill this.Have periodic reviews where you can change your direction and incorporate new ideas.Don't let your reviews interfere withthe short-term process of committing.
Title: The winding path: Goals and projects  Content: Imagine your ambitions on two levels:A goal level, which is big-picture and abstract. It has just enough detail to inspire, but not so much that you're stuck pursuing things that donâ€™t matter when conditions change.Underneath that, have projects: these tend to be short-to-medium term efforts you think will help realize the larger goal.The flexibility of the system comes once one leg of a short-term commitment has ended. This provides an opportunity for pivoting and redirecting.
