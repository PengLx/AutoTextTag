Title: Deep Friendships Content: A study on sixth-graders revealed that friendship is crucial and real for kids, and can be as deep as a parental relationship.Most parents and teachers do not understand the importance of deep bonding among friends at school and tend to regard friendships as a distraction or a nuisance.
Title: Social Isolation and Bullying Content: Social isolation is the dark side of the school, in which many kids with no friends are at risk of anxiety, depression and low self-esteem.There is a perceived sense of threat with being friendless, and the young, immature mind can deeply internalize the resulting difficulties, leading to depression.Bullying at this age is also a major problem, with those who are socially isolated becoming the most vulnerable to being bullied.
