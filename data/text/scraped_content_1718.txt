Title: Messing up at work Content: Overcoming mistakes at work starts with a difficult conversation.Though it may not seem like it, your aim is actually to increase the amount of trust you get from your boss.If they know you will come to them to alert them of problems you have caused, then they don’t necessarily need to look over your shoulder all the time.
Title: Don’t hide from your mistake Content: As soon as you find out that you have made a mistake, reach out to talk about it with your boss.If your boss requires an appointment, set one up right away—with some urgency. The less time you wait, the better. This will allow for a faster fix of any potentialnegative consequences.
Title: Be clear about what went wrong Content: Start with a few simple declarative sentences. “I did X. As a result, Y happened.”You can provide more context afterward, but it’s critical to lay out clearly what happened. Also, leave explanations for when the problem is fixed.
Title: Suggest a fix Content: Taking responsibility means doing whatever you can to repair the problem.Tell your boss anything you have done already to try to fix the problem. If you have other suggestions, lay them out. Work closely with your supervisor to understand better how to solve the situation.
Title: Plan for the future Content: You need to think through how you will handle situations like that in the future.Identify what went wrong. Did you act too quickly? Did you neglect to check your work? Did you listen to someone you shouldn’t have?
