Title: Balance Content: The ideal solution is to find balance between thinking and doing:Extreme thinkers can think about enhancing themselves to become the best at what they already do.Extreme doers are advised to do random activities, learning new skills, exposing oneself to unpredictable situations and pushing oneself out of the comfort zone.
Title: Thinker Vs Doer Content: Extreme thinkers don't have behavioral data (experience) to know specifics and to make a good choice; they keep trying different things, but for a short amount of time.Extreme doers are stuck in an activity for a long time and lack the analytical skills to use behavioral data towards assessing situations.
Title: Present-Oriented Approach Content: Our approach towards our life is always future-oriented. The trick is to change it to a present-oriented approach.Instead of asking "What do I like to do?", you need to ask yourself "what am I doing right now?"By questioning yourself from a high-level perspective you are not able to evaluate specific aspects of your likeness and preferences.By asking yourself about the present moment, and making it an ongoing process, you are able to do your best to steer yourself in the right direction, every waking minute.
