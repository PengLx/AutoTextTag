Title: What causes binge eating Content: You do a lot of cardio.Youhave been on a caloric deficit for months.Your dietis extremely restrictive.You target a low amount of calories on a daily basis.
Title: Go easy on the cardio Content: Cardio doesn't always necessarily lead to excess hunger or binging.Some people are more sensitive to large quantities of cardio and are more binge-prone than others. Reducing the amount of cardio lessens the urge to binge or makes it disappear altogether.
Title: Increase your total calories Content: Binge eaters tend to aggressively cut calories while leaningon willpower to deal with hunger and lack of energy.But willpower is limited, so this strategy will backfire.
Title: Choose a more flexible diet Content: Practice flexible dieting, which allows you to fit anything into your diet.You can't beat yourself up for eating something in the "bad food" category if you don't create one in the first place.
Title: Plan for failure Content: When you know that you have a diet-breaking event coming up, you can prevent binging by planning to fail.This way, you create a controlled binge day and that is psychologically different from an uncontrolled binge.
Title: Use Mindfulness Content: Each binge is preceded by a psychological trigger.If you examine your thought patterns, you'll realize that their rationale is completely false; objectively, you've probably never benefited from giving in to these thoughts.
