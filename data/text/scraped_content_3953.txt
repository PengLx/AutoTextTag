Title: Happiness Paradox Content: Most people are pressed for time, not having much of it to spend on doing things they love or want to do.Happiness should, therefore, be equated with more free time, but that isn't the case.Busy people tend to be happier than the ones with no work.
Title: Free Time and Life Satisfaction Content: There is a correlation between the number of hours of free time one gets and their life satisfaction.People's free time might be less fulfilling if they can't spend it with others.People with a lot of free time tend to feel low in self-esteem.
Title: Discretionary time Content: It is your time, doing what you want to do. People like to use their discretionary time with activities like watching TV, socializing, going to the mall or movies, spending time with their loved ones, or just doing nothing.Discretionary time is the variable that decides how happy one is in their life.
