Title: Living with integrity Content: It's far better to be yourself and risk having people not like you than to suffer the stress and tension that comes from pretending to be someone you’re not, or professing to like something that you don’t.
Title: People pleasing Content: It's the process of trying to guess what other people want and what will make them like us, and then acting accordingly.It's actually a way of manipulating people'sperceptions of us.
Title: We're not that good at pretending Content: We don’t actually fool anyone when we're trying to look happy, but our real feelings are far from positive.Our expressions expose us and are registered and mirrored by other people. So trying to suppress negative emotionsactually increases stress levels of both people more than if we had shared our distress in the first place.
Title: We find it harder to focus Content: The act of pretending translates into a big conscious effort of willpower thatdrains your brain of its ability to focus and do deep work.Self-control is like a muscle, and like any muscle, when used repeatedly, it tires and will perform poorly.You'll also feel a lot of stress and anxiety in your body.
