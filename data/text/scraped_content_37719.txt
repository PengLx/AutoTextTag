Title: A Deep Feeling Of Unworthiness Content: Suffering cannot be eradicated by money or accomplishments. Deep-rooted pain can be managed to some extent by using props and gimmicks in the name of self-improvement, but they donâ€™t cater to the basic feeling of unworthiness, which can even make the process of self-improvment into a problem.
Title: Dopamine-Fuelled Highs Content: The short-term feeling of success can be achieved using various self-improvement techniques, but any improvement that does not address the basic problem of unworthiness and a constant suffering deep inside us, is simply noise.There are always two sides to a coin and one has to endure the discomfort of being alone with oneself, among other things, moving towards an acceptance of all the facets of life.One has to be neutral and face life without a filter to be able to experience authentic growth and evolve as a human.
