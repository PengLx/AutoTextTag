Title: Human forgetting follows a pattern Content: In the first hour after you learn something, if nothing is done with new the information, you will forget about 50% of it.After 24 hours, this percentage goes up to 70%, and if a week goes by without that information being put to work, up to 90% of it could be lost.
Title: Sometimes the brain forgets on purpose Content: A big part of our forgetting is related to a healthy functioning of our memory: our brains select what’s important and dismiss the rest.Studies show that forgetting plays a positive role in how the brain works - forgetting has the potential to increase long-term retention, information retrieval and performance.
Title: Deliberately remembering something Content: When you deliberately remember something you’ve learned or came across recently, you signal to your brain that it needs to hold onto that piece of information.When you are exposed to the same information multiple times, it takes less time to trigger and set in motion the information in your long-term memory and it becomes easier for you to fetch the information when you need it.
Title: The 50/50 rule for remembering what you learn Content: Devote 50% of your time to learning something new and the rest of your time to teaching and sharing what you have learned with others.Studies shows that explaining something to someone else is the best way to learn it yourself.
