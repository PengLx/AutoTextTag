Title: How Ideas are Made Content: Generating ideas is the process of finding new connections between old ideas.We have to be able to connect the dots, cross-pollinate ideas from various disciplines, and combine and recombine them to create new ideas.
Title: A Safe Environment Content: Create a safe place, free from criticism, because we tend to clam up if we feel like we're going to be criticized.Rather than criticizing what you don't like, focus on getting ideas out in the open so you can build on them.
Title: Scratch Your Own Itch Content: The most successful ideas will be related to your own particular observations on your needs, or what you see is missing in the world.
Title: Being Passion About Ideas Content: If you have a stack of ideas, you have to be ruthless about which ones you choose to pursue.Give time for the ideas to settle. You'll find you are much less excited about some of the ideas you've written down. During the process of pursuing an idea, someone will have to be personally convicted of the idea and want to fight for it.
Title: Put Some Ideas Aside Content: You're inevitably going to have to say 'no' to some of the ideas you want to execute. Give your ideas room to breathe before you assess them.Look at your ideas objectively.Choose the ones that have the best chance for success or that support your goals the best.Put other ideas aside for a while.
