Title: Us Vs Our Ideal Self Content: Most of us live dual lives, filled with ambivalence. On the one hand, we have a person who we really are and on the other hand, a person who we would like to be. We use promises and resolutions to try and bridge the gap.Promise carries some accountability, and a resolution is simply a desire. Both of these point towards the person we would like to become, the optimized, ideal person that we can only imagine.
Title: Outdated Stories Content: We keep hanging on the outdated promises that no longer serve us, or are no longer relevant. They also take the shape of excuses we have kept frozen inside our minds for decades.
Title: A Different Approach Content: Identify the stories you tell yourself that no longer serve you, inviting others in the conversation.Set up an accountable pattern of change, keeping your friends/family in the loop.Make a promise which is known to your loved ones, for answerability.If some promises need to be broken, do not hesitate.Get back up and on track after a setback.
