Title: Postponing Things With Little Value Content: We often have an urge to do things that have no productive value, but we still do them due to the forces of habit or when we cannot say no to others.An effective way to deal with such tasks is to delay them.Whether it is snacking, playing a video game, browsing videos, or even smoking, one can delay the desire for doing the activity by keeping oneself intentionally busy.
Title: Listen To Understand Content: While listening to others speak, a million thoughts come to our mind, about how we have handled similar situations, and how many mistakes the other person has made in what is being stated. We normally blurt out at the first chance and criticize the other person, or boast about our superhuman abilities.A better way is to delay that, keeping quiet and simply listening to the other person, focusing on one's breath if needed.
Title: Things That Should Not Be Delayed Content: Do not delay with stuff like appreciating someone, building something great, helping people, supporting someone in need and other positive things that need to be done right now.
