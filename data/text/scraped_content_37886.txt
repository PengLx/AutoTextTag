Title: Exercise: What To Aim For Content: Research has shown that even a few minutes of exercise leads to benefits.**Itâ€™s all about increasing the intensity.**The ideal exercise for adults are :150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise a week, such as running, swimming, brisk walking, cycling, tennis, and doing yark work.2 sessions of about 30 minutes of resistance training a week.

Title: Get Your Blood Pressure Checked Content: High blood pressure puts mechanical stress on the walls of your arteries, making them to narrow and harden. Stress can increase the development of plaque and cause your heart muscle to weaken over time.Your blood pressure should be no higher than 120/80. The top number (systolic) is the pressure when your heart is contracting. The lower number (diastolic pressure) is when your heart is at rest.You're at greater risk if you are older, have diabetes, have complicating conditions such as sleep apnea, kidney disease, obesity, high levels of stress, or heavy alcohol consumption.

Title: Know Your Cholesterol Content: Cholesterol plays a big role in heart disease. The heart association recommends getting your cholesterol levels measured every four to six years.HDL cholesterol. Higher HDL levels are considered better for cardiovascular health.LDL cholesterol. High LDL is linked to heart diseases and low LDL with cardiovascular health.Triglycerides. This is a type of fat in your bloodstream. High numbers of triglycerides are linked to both heart disease and diabetes.
Title: Eat Your Way to a Lower Cholesterol Content: Many foods can improve your cholesterol levels. They include:Fatty fish, which lowers LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.Walnuts, almonds, and other nuts. They increase HDL and lower LDL cholesterol.Soybeans, tofu, and soy milk slightly lower LDL.Apples, strawberries, and citrus fruits contain pectin, which helps to reduce LDL.Olive oil and unsaturated fats.Beans, vegetables, and flaxseeds contain a lot of soluble fiber and may lower LDL.Triglycerides are driven mostly by empty carbs. Removing sugar, bread, pasta, fruit juices, and other refined carbs from your diet should lower your triglycerides.
Title: Know Your Blood Sugar Level Content: A high fasting blood sugar level can indicate Type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes. People with diabetes are four times more likely to die from heart disease.An A1C test indicates your average blood sugar levels over time. It measures the amount of glycated hemoglobin in your blood, which shows your average blood sugar levels over the past three months.An A1C score below 5.7 is normal.A score between 5.7 and 6.4 is indicative of pre-diabetes.A score of 6.5 or above indicates diabetes.
Title: How to Lower Your Blood Sugar Content: Aside from a medical issue, you can do two things to improve your blood sugar control: exercise and eating smart.Things that can contribute to chronically high blood sugar or throw off a test are:A lack of sleepBeing overweight or obeseConsuming alcohol or caffeine.Birth control pills, antidepressants, nasal decongestants and other medications.Hormonal changes during menstrual cycles.Chronic stress or illness.

Examples include potato chips, chicken nuggets, canned soups, instant noodles, and boxed snacks.
Title: Maintain a Healthy Bodyweight Content: Excess body fat cells release many substances that increase inflammation, promote insulin resistance, and contribute to the hardening of arteries.Visceral fat - the type that collects deep inside your abdomen around your internal organs - is more toxic to your cardiovascular system than subcutaneous fat, the kind that sits just below your skin.The amount of visceral fat you carry can be determined by measuring your waist circumference. Women at high risk have a waist circumference of 35 inches or greater, and men with a waist circumference above 40 inches are at a greater risk.
Title: Quit Smoking Content: Smoking is the most common cause of heart disease. Smoking causes emphysema, cancer, gum disease, and harms almost every organ in your body. Tobacco smoke damages blood vessels, increases blood pressure, lowers HDL cholesterol, and causes peripheral artery disease and atherosclerosis.Quitting will immediately lower your risk of a heart attack.
Title: Alternative Ways to Boost Your Cardiovascular Health Content: Get a pet. Dogs, in particular, have shown to lower your risk of heart disease.Reduce stress.

Plant compounds circulating in the forest air may also provide health benefits.
