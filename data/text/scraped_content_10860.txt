Title: Seasonal Storms Content: Tornadoes don’t really have a particular season and can form any time of the year. They do occur more frequently in Spring and Fall.
Title: Opening The Windows Content: There is a misconception that opening house windows causes the high pressure of the house and low pressure of the tornado to cancel each other out, and that the house can explode if windows are left closed.In reality, opening the windows does no good and only lets the wind and debris enter your house.
Title: Protection of A Bridge Content: According to experts, seeking shelter in a highway overpass or a bridge can be dangerous, as it can cause a ‘wind tunnel’ and sweep you from right under the bridge, or worse, can collapse the bridge if it is weak.The safer option is to lie low (and flat) in a ditch or low spot.
Title: Big And Small Cities Content: Tornadoes can occur anywhere but it seems they are witnessed more in small cities or rural areas. It is not to say that they cannot occur in big cities.
Title: Mountains and Tornadoes Content: Tornadoes are less common in hilly and mountainous areas, due to the cool, stable air of the regions of higher elevations. The mountains have their own ‘windward sides’ which make the tornadoes break up or weaken.
Title: Flat Lands Content: Tornadoes are generally observed in flat fields, leading to the belief that they only occur in open terrains. Though mountain friction and winds do stop them a little, they can easily be formed over water, so are not entirely land-based.
Title: The Southwest Part of Your Home Content: Tornadoes don’t have a particular direction of arrival, like the Southwest. They can come from any side of the house and even if they come from a particular direction, the wind can blow in other directions and carry debris anywhere.
