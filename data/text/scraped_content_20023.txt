Title: Venting At The Office Content: Due to the stress accumulation, many team members and managers vent out in their daily team meetings. Whether itâ€™s work problems, family struggle, or mental health, they find it therapeutic to unload it to others. This kind of venting, however, can be stressful for others, especially if they are being forced to listen. Negative ranting wears down the listener and uses up the emotional bandwidth, making them anxious.
Title: Negativity-Free Meetings Content: Preserve your sanity in a VC meeting by these methods:Introduce ground rules in the meeting requesting it to be free of negative talk, on the pretext of detoxing the audience/team members and improving their mental health.Intentionally keep things positive, promoting sharing of positive things and ending the meeting on a high note, so that the negative is by default kept out, without pinpointing it.In case a higher-up or a boss is the one with the negative talk, one can bite the bullet and request the person personally and politely to stop or reduce the negative banter.
