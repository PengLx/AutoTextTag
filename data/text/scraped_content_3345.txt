Title: See with new eyes Content: Take a familiar object from your home and examine it as if you’ve never seen it before.Is there something you’d forgotten or never noticed before, or is your experience or reaction altered by your interest?
Title: Notice how objects feel Content: Take an object from your home and focus on its texture,touching it as if for the first time. Notice how the experience feels right now, as you interact with it.You could also work with an inner feeling,directing awareness to a part of your body, noticing what sensations are present.
Title: Hearing, smelling, and tasting anew Content: Take your attention in turn to three everyday objects in your environment that you can hear, smell, or taste (for example, the ticking of a clock, a flower, a piece of fruit).Let go of expectations, and instead allow your senses to lead you into the direct experience of hearing, smelling, or tasting itself.
Title: Stuck in old habits Content: When life begins to feel repetitive, it's a sign you've gotten stuck in old habits.When we get stuck on autopilot, we lose touch with actual experience—which can always be interesting if we bring our curiosity to it.
