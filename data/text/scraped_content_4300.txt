Title: Traffic jams Content: Most traffic jams are unnecessary. Local transport engineers manage to achieve local improvements, but after a while the flows rearrange, and the same traffic jams appear elsewhere.Mathematicians who specialize in traffic flow would like to solve urban traffic jams forever.
Title: Math approaches to traffic Content: All drivers need to be on the same navigation system. Cars can only be efficiently rerouted if instructions come from the same hub.Many urban roads are too narrow. Traffic-flow models can indicate where parking spots should be turned into lanes.Green lanes incentive.For cities that want to increase electric car use, special lanes should be created for electric cars.Digital twins.Digital modeling can create an entire “twin” of existing roadways to assist transport engineers.
