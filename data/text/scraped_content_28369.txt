Title: Endless choices are rabbit holes to nowhere Content: With infinite options come increased choices. More choices mean more decisions.  However, choice overload makes you question your decisions. This leads to decision fatigue and can cause you to get stuck in negative cycles. You may constantly question the decisions youâ€™ve made and be left wondering what could have been.Instead of inviting more choices, you need discernment and confidence to close more doors until you're unaware of them.
Title: Intentionally moving forward Content: The best decision-makers purposefully avoid almost all of the options available. To commit to one decision means closing the door on everything else. It takes confidence to say, "This is what I'm serious about. I can't be distracted by everyone else's noise and agendas." If you're serious about achieving goals, you must create an environment that shields you from other noise.
Title: Strategic ignorance Content: Strategic ignorance is not about being closed-minded. It's knowing what you want. It's realizing how easy a person can be derailed. You even avoid amazing situations that you know is really a distraction. You create boundaries and live your priorities and values and dreams.
