Title: Our Habits Fuel Our Happiness Content: We are creatures of habit. Whether those habits serve us or hinder us is the difference between being happy or being stuck in a life where we merely exist.Choosing the right habits is the ultimate lifehack to help you be happier. And those habits may be different for each of us.
Title: Happiness Exists In Our Thoughts Content: Our happiness is a byproduct of our thoughts but focusing on only having positive thoughts is unrealistic. Instead, focus on not dwelling on the negative ones.
Title: A Life Without Judgement Content: We judge because we want to know the answer before we understand the challenge. The first step in moving past judgement is releasing the need for an answer.Instead of judging, form an opinion. Judgements are assumptions that usually do not change. An opinion, however, is an isolated view of the world that can change with the discovery of new information.
Title: Use Your Life Well Content: We do plenty of activities that do not contribute to the fullness of our life, some of them are mandatory but others are optional. Understanding how you spend your time makes it simpler to choose to do things that lend value to it, and that even makes the mandatory tasks easier to do.
