Title: Limitations of Language Content: The rich and diverse aspects of human experience cannot be captured by the language of philosophy, no matter how rich it becomes.Great poets see life around them as we do, but they skillfully express it using words in such a way that they transcend the boundaries of literal language, providing insight towards the experience.Conformist and linear language is static, and life is flowing, is in a constant movement, and is fluid by nature.
Title: The Canvas Content: Literal language is functional, and is a utility, serving the purpose of communication, while poetry captures the beauty, the essence of an object, doing away with the descriptions and linear definitions.The creative nature of consciousness can be described by the analogy of a canvas. Our consciousness is a blank canvas initially and as we gain education, experiences and perform actions, we paint this canvas, slowly adding details, and the final work of art is the story of our lives.Our expression of creativity is born out of the interactions and experiences we keep having. The canvas that we paint can be cohesive and whole or can be broken and messy.
Title: The Truth Shines Content: There are some creative and artistic people who are genuinely authentic in anything they do. They are having a secret inside them, a fragrance that comes with completeness and realism. These people have, through hardships, suffering, and reconciliation, have discovered a core inside them, a certain light that is brightly shining.This quality shines through in the writings and works of genuine artists. Maybe their poetry, which is seemingly so profound, isnâ€™t poetry at all, but pure truths that they have simply expressed honestly.
