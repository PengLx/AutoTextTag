Title: Fixing Bad Situations Content: We are often in situations or circumstances which we don't like. Bad things happen, and it is a natural tendency to focus on negative circumstances. Wishing that someone you work with, like your boss, would be different, or that your health will be different is a futile exercise.Focusing on changing the bad things feels like doing something productive, but isn't taking us anywhere, and it becomes a waste of time and energy.
Title: Focus On The Solution Content: Bad situations and circumstances are not always personal, and not about you. Stop focussing on unworkable options and fixing things (and people) that clearly cannot be fixed.Start to find workable options in a problem, which may not be perfect, but good enough, and are steps towards progress.
