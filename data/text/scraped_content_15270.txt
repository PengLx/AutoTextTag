Title: Kindness is a Mystery Content: The value of kindness, consideration and empathy towards others is a valuable social tool, which isn’t properly understood.An experiment shows that people can sense your attitude towards them if you are genuinely caring for them, even if you don’t show it by any visual cue or symbol.Your internal feelings of coldness or warmness towards others, somehow reciprocate in others, as if they are able to read your good (or bad) intentions.

Title: The Wealth Of Kindness Content: Capitalism has made us only understand one kind of wealth, as it is only concerned with the ‘monetary’ economy.Kindness and empathy towards others produce a different kind of wealth, which benefits everyone. Indifferences are quelled, and goodwill, warmth and support are produced.
