Title: Pretending to have cold feet Content: Scenario: You've reached a verbal agreement, but in negotiating the final terms, the deal gets questioned. "We're not really sure that this is the right thing for us to do at this time."The best strategy is probe further to see whether there's a real problem or whether you're just being yanked around.
Title: Surfacing an unreasonable requirement Content: Scenario: Working with a prospect to craft a deal and suddenly the customer demands something that makes no business sense."We'll need you to stop doing business with our competitors if you're doing business with us."Your best strategy is to call the customer's bluff.
Title: Requesting a last minute discount Content: Scenario: You're at the point of signing the contracts,when the prospect demands a steep discount.  Example: "My boss says that if don't drop the price 25 percent, the deal is off."The worst thing at this point is to give the discount, because then you've told the prospect you can't be trusted to offer the best deal.
Title: Stretching out the process Content: Scenario: The sales opportunity is proceeding apace when suddenly all the important meetings are pushed way out."I can't meet next Friday to discuss this; how about next month?"Your best strategy is to surface some negative consequences of delaying the sale.
