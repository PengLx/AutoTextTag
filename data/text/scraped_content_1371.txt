Title: A TED Talk is 18 minutes long Content: TED curator Chris Anderson explains: “The 18-minute length works much like the way Twitter forces people to be disciplined in what they write. By forcing speakers who are used to going on for 45 minutes to bring it down to 18, you get them to really think about what they want to say. What is the key point they want to communicate? It has a clarifying effect. It brings discipline.”
Title: Give a TED-style talk that gets a lot of views Content: Arrange your message onto the 9-up format: same size as sticky notes, until you are happy with the flow.Solicit feedback from effective presenters that you trust to give honest, unfiltered feedback on your narrative and slides.Rehearse with a great (honest) communicator that is not afraid to speak up.Articulate each point clearly. Practice with a clock counting up the minutes, to know how much you're over. Then trim it down.Once you're within the timeframe, practice with a clock counting down. Know where you should be at 6, 12 and 18 minutes.Let your coach jot down what you say well and what you don’t. Don’t be camera shy.  Practice by videotaping yourself.Do one more full timed rehearsal right before you walk on stage.Pick two natural places you could stop in your talk, then demarcate those as possible endings.
