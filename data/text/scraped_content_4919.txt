Title: Causing unintentional harm Content: We all cause harm to our partner and the intimacy between us. We make mistakes that are foolish and unintentional and sometimes launch attacks on purpose. When you wound another, apologize. Don't ignore the mistakes. When you inflict wounds, they can accumulate. Unacknowledged wounds can build a wall between you.
Title: How to give an apology Content: A good apology takes two people: the giver and the receiver. An apology that heals is based on kindness, generosity, and compassion.The recipient accepts it with grace and, in turn, offers forgiveness. Without forgiveness, it cannot heal.
Title: The mindful apology in practice Content: Repair:  An apology that rebuilds intimacy should have three parts: you need to own the mistake, and then you need to repair the damage. Lastly, you need to vow to improve.Forgive:If you have been hurt, you may never completely forget, but you can choose to forgive. To decide to forgive means that you don't relive something that belongs to the past.Begin again:Unfinished business will accumulate. Let go of the small and the large wounds, so they don't pile up.
