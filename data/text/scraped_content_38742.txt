Title: What is ‘precrastination’? Content: Described as “the hastening of subgoal completion, even at the expense of extra physical effort,” but it can apply to tasks (like office work) that don’t involve physical labor.Basically, you precrastinate if you opt to put in extra effort in the rush to complete a task (and tick it off your to-do list) that may end up being unnecessary with a little more time and planning. 
Title: Example of precrastination Content: You and your team are gearing up for a complex project, and they’ve sent a number of emails asking for clarification on certain points. Rather than taking the time to write back in a thoughtful and deliberate manner or schedule a call to discuss, you send back a series of half-baked replies.Eg from my perspective:When organizing the team on slack with small messages I find it to destroy my deepwork. Also the team is not very productive.A solution is to have a clear call where we go through all the plan and make a rule to disturb the other one only in case of a bottleneck, otherwise have a call after 6-8h and see whats up.
Title: Rules to avoid precrastination Content: Ask yourself, Would this task benefit from added time?  Precrastination happens when we’re working on autopilot. Though it may seem counterintuitive on busy days, stop and consider all the tasks on your plate. Those that require creativity, thoughtfulness or emotion will benefit from a slower response.Know which tasks you can rush through. If a task takes just a few minutes to complete, it can be helpful to get it done quickly in favor of clearing your attentional space.Keep a calendar and to-do list. This might not seem revelatory, but externalizing what’s cluttering your mind is a wonderful thing. Tracking appointments, tasks, distractions and ideas using a notepad or smartphone app allows you to step back and organize. In addition to freeing up mental space, these tools can help you decide where to channel future energy.
