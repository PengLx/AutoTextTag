Title: FOMO Comes From Unhappiness Content: You’re not feeling so great — whether you realize it or not — and you turn to social media to make you feel better. Only one problem there: it actually makes you feel worse…
Title: The Facebook Illusion Content: We all know that Facebook doesn’t provide a very well-rounded picture of people’s lives. It’s more like the cherry-picked perfection version.People with FOMO have ambivalent feelings toward Facebook. It brings them up when they post about their own carefully edited version of life awesomeness, and slams them back down when they feel they have to compete with other people's lifestyle awesomeness - especially when they're feeling a little down or anxious themselves.
Title: The Problem Is Attention Content: Looking at social media for happiness is a bad idea. You won’t find it out there.Your happiness is determined by how you allocate your attention. What you attend to drives your behavior and it determines your happiness.Changing behavior and enhancing happiness is as much about withdrawing attention from the negative as it is about attending to the positive.
Title: Gratitude Content: Try to focus on gratitude to turn your attention so that you appreciate the real world and not turn to Facebook.The inevitable comparisons to the fake lives on Facebook makes you feel you have less. Contemplating what you are lucky to already possess makes you feel you have more.
