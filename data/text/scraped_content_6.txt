Title: Action isn’t the effect of motivation, but the cause of it Content: It is often believed that action needs to be preceded by motivation, which is preceded by inspiration. Not at all. It's the opposite: Action provides the Inspiration that gets you Motivated.Your actions create the emotional reactions to motivate your future actions.Not the other way around.
Title: The “Do Something” Principle Content: If you lack the motivation to make an important change in your life, do something, anything really,even the smallest of actions, to get inspiration and motivation to do something else.You will think “OK, I did that, I guess I can do more.” And slowly we could take it from there.
