Title: Frame items in a positive way Content: Either [our goals are] about doing more of something good, or they’re about doing less of something bad.Goals framed in a positive, constructive way are more powerful than “avoidance goals” in leading us to become more productive.
Title: Why your goals matter Content: We’re more likely to get something done when we take a moment to think about why it matters to us personally.Intrinsic goals are motivated by values meaningful to you, such as growth and relationships. These are much more motivating than extrinsic goals—efforts motivated by money, status, or other external factors.
Title: Create a “when-then” plan Content: To get something done, it helps to get very specific about what we’ll do and when we’ll do it.Setting simple implementation intentions as part of a when-then plan make people as much as three times more likely to achieve their goals.
Title: Make your goals smaller Content: You’ll get more stuff done when you break your bigger daily goals into bite-sized chunks.In practice, you’re basically breaking an item on your to-do list down into many mini ones. This makes it feel as though your goals are more within reach.
