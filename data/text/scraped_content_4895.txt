Title: Flattening the curve Content: It means that all the social distancing measures being adopted these days in many countries arenâ€™t so much about preventing illness but rather slowing down the rate at which people get sick with the new disease.This takes off the pressure of hospitals and it makes it possible to have the space and qualified personnel for treating the real sensitive cases (older people, for example).
Title: Preventing system overload Content: Staying home during the pandemic helps prevent health systems from being overloaded.Overloading hospitals can likely be averted with protective measures like closing schools, canceling mass gatherings, working from home, self-quarantine, self-isolation, avoiding crowds. All these keep the virus from spreading fast.
