Title: Connect with people emotionally Content: If you want to intrigue and influence people, you have to get their dopamine pumping.A great way to do that is by having excellent conversation starters handy: “What was the best part of your day and what was the worst part of your day?” and “What personal passion project are you currently working on right now?”
Title: Be emotionally curious Content: Become genuinely interested in other people. A great way to do this is to ask them open-ended questions.Everyone wants to be liked, loved and accepted. When you fulfill that need for others, you are perceived as being influential.
Title: Use high-powered body language Content: When you manifest powerful body language, you are seen as more influential. The head is held high, the arms are loose, the shoulders are set back and the chest is out. Confident body language not only affects the way others see you but also the way you see yourself. 
Title: Tell a story Content: When someone tells a story, the brain of the other person may be in sync with the storyteller. If you can stimulate the other person’s brain with a story, you can, in effect, get that person on your side.
Title: Be vulnerable Content: Being open about your emotions increases your likeability and influence.People will perceive you as being real when you admit to weaknesses or flaws.
Title: Use the Ben Franklin effect - Ask a favor Content: The Benjamin Franklin effect is a psychological phenomenon that causes us to like someone more after we do that person a favor.So asking for help is one of the best things you could do to be perceived as an influential person.
