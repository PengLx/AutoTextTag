Title: Patterns in successful people Content: Wherever they excel, they tend to have personal rules that they take very seriously:Financially effective people tend to hold themselves to certain rules about money.Fit, energetic people tend to have personal rules about health.Productive people keep personal rules about work.
Title: Setting standards Content: Your quality of life improves when you set clear standards for how you live.You gravitate back towards “so-so” in any area where your standards are unclear.
Title: Dismissing self-discipline Content: This notion that personal rules constitute “forcing yourself” is just a way of dismissing self-discipline as a possibility, for oneself or others.For example: brushing your teeth every day doesn’t require any sort of forcing or obsessing, just dental hygiene standards you consider non-negotiable.
Title: "Losing" freedom Content: We’ve all experienced the pain of living under unfair or unsympathetic rules, especially the ones imposed on us as children by teachers and grownups.We fear the prospect of losing any of our freedom, and we tend to think of rules as devices that only constrain.
Title: Self-imposed rules aren’t constraints Content: They’re good decisions made in batches—they’re behavioral boundary markers you get to position yourself, through your own experience and wisdom. Despite our fear of rules, the feeling of acting in accordance with a well-considered personal rule is actually a palpable feeling of power and independence.
