Title: The Trap I’ve Fallen into Content: You see, I’d beenintendingto do some sort of course about theMCAT/Passive income stuff for ages. But I’d been procrastinating from it for way too long.In my head, I kept thinking of it as some sort of Big Deal. And because it was a Big Deal, I told myself I had to spend ages planning the course, figuring out the best content material, researching the best strategies, creating the most optimized schedule, and a load of other stuff.Then someone said, “look, why don’t you stop talking about doing this course or whatever and actually just do the course?”At that moment, it was like a lightbulb went off in my head. I realised that I’d fallen into the trap of endless planning, and no execution. Sure, there’s a time and place for planning. But usually, most of us go way too overboard on the planning front, especially if what we need to do feels hard or unclear.As someone famous once said, “the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step”.The main thing is that you take that first step, and start, because if you keep onplanning, you’ll never end updoing.So what are you currentlyplanningas procrastination from actuallydoing? And what are you doing half-heartedly that you could be doing consistently instead, to benefit from compounding returns?
