Title: The 21st-Century Syndrome Content: This ‘21st-century Syndrome’ is due to two factors:An overabundance of dopamine-inducing options is taking its toll on our minds, making it difficult to relax. A sea of unprocessed emotions coupled with social disconnection is making us constantly uneasy.Our brains are facing an onslaught of information and ‘supernormal stimuli’ from a variety of sources like social media, gaming, pornography and the likes.
Title: Distractions Can Be Useful Content: The brain needs time and space to process information. The breaks we take during work, like talking to a colleague at the watercooler provides a ‘downtime’ and helps process information. This takes the shape of distractions when we are at home. You could even be problem-solving while quietly doing the laundry at home, as your brain processes the events and information in the background.
Title: Unshared Fears Lead Us Into Distraction Content: Our feelings, emotions and fears remain largely unshared at home, when we are trying to do many things at once, fighting countless battles single-handedly to balance everything.Not having someone to talk to gets us into distractions, and when we force ourselves to not indulge, it makes us want to do it more.
Title: The Identity Pact Content: Providing yourself with an identity of the kind of person you aspire to be, like a non-smoker, a non-distractible person or someone who is sober and calm, provides a narrative for you to focus on.The more you tell yourself what kind of person you are, the more it turns out to be true.
