Title: "Okay, let's do this" Content: Despite all the doubt, fear or negativity, take the leap. Publish that post. Start that company.When you get tired of thinking about a piece of work but not doing it, say "Okay, let's do this" and do it. Start with something, anything.
Title: Start sloppy Content: Trying to aim for high expectations can put more pressure on you, leading you to avoid work by procrastinating.Instead, start deliberately badly. When you know that you don't have to make the greatest thing ever, it's easier to start and easier to continue.
Title: Start small Content: You might not feel like writing a whole final thesis, but you can write a paragraph or two before lunch break.Those are small steps. Every small step builds momentum. Momentum energizes and can lead to ultimately completing the long journey.
