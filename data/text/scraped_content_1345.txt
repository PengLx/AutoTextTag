Title: Be A Lion Not A Dog Content: Dada Vaswani when he was a small boy asked a monk to give him some wisdom.The monk advised "My child, Be a Lion, not a dog. -When you throw a ball in front of the dog, it will run after the ball. When you throw something at the Lion its attention is still on you, not on the object you throw. It will be waiting to grab hold of you.Always focus on the source, not the incidents, not the effects. Go to the source".
