Title: The end of anxiety Content: The moment you start acting on something, you are at the beginning of the end of the anxiety associated with that thing.Many procrastinators are pessimists and overestimate the difficulty of the task they are avoiding. They think doing it is the hard part. But not doing it is much harder.

Title: Anxiety associated with obligations Content: It comes from a misapprehension of what it will actually be like to do the work.This anxiety is made of abstract, big-picture emotional concerns, about reputation, legacy, anxiety for the future, self-esteem, comparisons to others — worries about who you are, rather than what you’re doing.
Title: Finishing a task Content: You finish a thing by starting it until it’s done.Finishing is only a matter of starting from where you are, as many times as you have to until it’s done.
