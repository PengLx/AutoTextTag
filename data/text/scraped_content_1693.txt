Title: Boost Learning Speed Content: Learners proficient in fast-paced games are significantly faster at performing new cognitive tasks.By pretending you are teaching something to someone using simple language, you understand it better.Bilingual people may have a leg up when it comes to understanding new things and processing information, regardless of the learned language. Learning new materialright before sleeping provides a significant retention advantage.Establishing as many connections as possible is an effective way to learn, and the best way to do that is to relate new information to known information.The brain processes visual information faster than text. Include relevant visuals (charts, symbols, diagramsâ€¦) with learning materials to improve retention.
Title: Perceptual Learning Content: Is the idea that we learn unconsciously through our senses in a self-regulated way, without requiring external reinforcement.More simply, you can learn to intuitively identify different situations or images through directly experiencing them in a fast-paced manner.
Title: Learning By Switching Focus Content: We have 2 modes of thinking: focused (highly intensive mental processes when you are acutely aware of what you are thinking), and diffuse (a more relaxed mental process associated with sub-conscious thinking).Sometimes the first solution found prevents you from seeing a wider range of possible solutions. To sidestep that, repeatedly intersperse short periods of intense focus on new information with periods of relaxed diffuse thinking.
