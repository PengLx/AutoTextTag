Title: Focus On Keystone Habits  Content: Keystone habits lead to the development of multiple good habits.Exercise is a good example of this. Once you start to change your exercise habits, it sets off a chain reaction that changes other habits as well: you start feeling good about your body, you eat healthy foods, you procrastinate less, etc.
Title: Use “Minimum Viable Effort” Content: Focus on baby steps.The key to new good habits is to do the minimum and be consistent.Do not be ambitious at the beginning. That leads to failure. Consistency is what you’re shooting for, so make the hurdle as low as possible.
Title: Make A Plan Content: Thinking about the details makes you more likely to follow through.Just writing down your plan also makes a big difference in effectively committing to your goals.
Title: Reward Yourself Content: Tie a “want” to a “should.”For example: if you want to listen to an audiobook but you know you should go to the gym, allow yourself to only listen to audiobooks while working out.
Title: Use Reminders Content: Mark the calendar. Set the alarm. Use a checklist.When you’re trying to break bad habits, you need to resist. But with good habits, you need to remind.
Title: Get Help From Friends Content: Peer pressure works. And a good support network shows us that change is possible.Hang out with pals who have the habit you want.Across many different kinds of behavior (voting, smoking, weight loss and weight gain, happiness,etc), people are very meaningfully affected by the behaviors of other people to whom they’re connected.
