Title: Sea reflects you Content: "Every time I walk towards you, it brings in a tune into my mind along which my emotions dance around."I always feel that sea mirrors our emotions. It might not be the same for everyone but I always get this intense feeling of seeing myself in the rhythm of waves. The way the waves come in, wash the shore and move back slowly bringing in and taking away elements continuously.
