Title: Conducting Great Interviews Content: Do not immediately jump to questions focusing on the topic at hand.Coax, don't hammer. There will be times that the interviewee will have a hard time answering some questions.Make some questions open ended.Ask what you don't know.Let the interviewees wander a bit, but always be in control.Tell the topics and subjects you wish to cover but don't send advance questions.Do not ask the questions that were already asked on previous interviews.Listen.They key is to pay close attention to what is not answered and make on-the-spot judgements on why that area was skipped or glossed.Try not to ask a question that your subject has already answered. It discloses that you really weren't listening after all.
