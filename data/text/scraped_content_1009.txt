Title: The Flaw in Jordan Peterson’s Argument On Hierarchy Content: Peterson suggests human hierarchies aren’t socially created, but are effects of human evolution. His evidence for this is the fact that lobsters also have hierarchies.Human and lobsters ancestors diverged millions of years before lobsters evolved, so their hierarchy developed independently of human societal structures. Another difference is that lobster hierarchy is mostly determined by biological factors like size and aggressiveness.
Title: The Flaw In Jordan Peterson’s Comparison Between Humans And Lobsters Content: Serotonin is linked to aggression and is found in the brains of most animals, humans and lobsters include, as expected of creatures with a common ancestor. But serotonin has a completely different effect in arthropods and vertebrates.In vertebrates lowered levels of serotonin has been shown to lead to increased aggression, the opposite happens on humans.
