Title: Quiz yourself Content: This is an extremely effective way to speed up the learning process.If you quiz yourself and answer incorrectly, you are more likely to remember the right answer after you look it up and you'll also remember the fact you didn't remember.
Title: Summarize and share Content: Even just thinking that you'll need to teach someone can make you learn more effectively.Teaching means seeking out key points and organizing information into a coherent structure.
Title: Use associative learning Content: Connect what you just learned to experiences you previously had.Associative learning is the process of relating something new to something you already know.
