Title: Playing by your rules Content: If you believe that playing by your own rules is a good philosophy for your life, then it’s important to believe the same applies to others.
Title: Setting your own rules Content: Gaining control of your own world is a liberating thing, but giving it up elsewhere feels risky and uncomfortable. If you want others to give up their stake in how you run yours, then you have to give up your stake in how they run theirs.
Title: Don’t think you’re too special Content: You’re unique but in the kind of way that everyone else is. When you discover you know a thing or two about something important to you, do what you can to help others take advantage of your knowledge, but don’t set the rules for how they have to use it.
