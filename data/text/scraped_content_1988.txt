Title: Maintain Optimal Stress Levels Content: The optimal stress level for people to reach peak productivity is when they’re under some stress but not overloaded.If stress levels are entering the red-zone, taking breaks has been found to be an incredible regulator in maintaining, or reducing, stress levels.
Title: Quit Overthinking and Move On Content: When you stop fully concentrating on one thing and take a break from the problematic task, your subconscious mind is still working away in the background finding a solution.Higher levels of stress often correlate with overthinking a particular subject, so if you want to make concrete logical connections without even trying – simply move on and it’ll likely come to you.
Title: Better Regulate Your Emotions Content: Human beings are naturally emotional and must stay self-critical in order to feel a full range of emotions to be healthy and productive.To stay emotionally well, it has been found that pre-emptively taking breaks before they are needed can be an effective method to strike the perfect balance at work.
Title: Exercise The 'Focus Muscles' Content: Physically, after strenuous exercise, our bodies need ample rest and balanced nutrition for our muscles to recover and grow stronger and bigger.After hours of intense concentration on a particular subject, puzzle or problem, we need to give our “focus muscles” enough time to rest and re-cooperate.
