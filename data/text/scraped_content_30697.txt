Title: Mistakes in predicting our future feelings Content: We are not very good at guessing how we'll feel in the future. In predicting how we will feel in the future, we commonly use the past experience as a guide. But our brain favours the extreme and most recent events. We tend to focus on the main features of an event and less on the journey to get there. This means that we won't always make the best decisions about our lives.
Title: Overestimating our future emotions Content: We overestimate the strength of our emotions in the future. Studies show that people overestimated their happiness at winning and their disappointment at losing because they forgot all the other things that would happen in a day that would influence their mood.
Title: Feelings are not long-lasting Content: A lottery winner, for instance, won't spend every day celebrating their win. Nor will someone with a disabling accident spend all their time in shock.When imagining either situation, we like to think that the feelings will be long-lasting. We forget that we will adapt and that the feeling will eventually wear off.
Title: How we can make good decision Content: When we have a decision to make, it is recommended to solicit the views of people who have had the experience you're considering.We can also ask the opinions of those around us since people tend to take a longer-term view when thinking about other people's choices. The kind of questions we ask is also important. Instead of asking if you should take the new job, ask what they think your day-to-day life will be like if you take it.
