Title: Universal fear Content: Some fears are acquired based on specific life experiences.Other fears are more universal, like the fear of darkness.Darkness leaves us vulnerable and exposed, unable to spot any threats that may be hiding nearby. Darkness means danger, and fearing it means taking precautions to stay safe.
Title: Fear in adults Content: Our brains equate darkness with the frightening side of unlimited possibility.As we become adults, we eventually become comfortable enough to move through the dark without a light.However, 40% of respondents in a survey said they were afraid to walk around the house with the light off. 10% won't get out of bed to use the bathroom in the middle of the night.
Title: Poor sleepers Content: In some cases, fear may be powerful enough to cause chronic insomnia.However, a person may not be able to sleep because their mind starts to wander.They may think what if someone breaks into their house. Instead of realizing the associations may indicate a fear of the dark, they inadvertently assume they have a fear of burglars.
