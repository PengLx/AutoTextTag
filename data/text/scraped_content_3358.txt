Title: The 'dark factor' Content: A love of horror movies is associated with an underlying dimension of entertainment preferences, dubbed "the dark factor".Those with dark tastes value intensity, edginess and rebellion. Their personalities lean towards risk-taking, antagonism, imagination, and tough-mindedness.
Title: The pleasure paradox Content: Some derive enjoyment from negative emotional states, as when enjoying a "good cry", for instance.Studies found that people who like sad films enjoy a scene relative to how much sadness it elicited. The stronger the sadness, the higher the enjoyment.
Title: Trick or treat Content: Halloween seems to bring out excesses in costumed children and adults.Several studies revealed that costumed children who were anonymous — by wearing masks for instance — were more likely to take extra candies. In adults, costumed Halloween celebrators tend to have higher blood alcohol readings than people in plain clothes.
