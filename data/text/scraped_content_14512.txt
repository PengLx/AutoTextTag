Title: Digital anxiety Content: We are addicted to our phones-that is a fact we are all aware of. Furthermore, in periods of time when we cannot have direct interactions with other individuals, we even tend to obsess over our mobile phones, as we see them as the only ones able to provide us with a sense of connectivity.
Title: Set boundaries in regards to your screen time Content: Whenever you feel like you are spending way too much time on your screen, consider setting clear boundaries: it is not the same to work and to just waste your time by watching things that might even end up increasing your anxiety. Therefore, try using a separate device for work and personal activities and, the most important, make sure to set a limit to the amount of time spent while checking news on social media.
Title: Choose quality over quantity Content: Whenever you choose to spend your time on checking social media, make sure this is not a wasted time. So why not trying to learn something useful during the days when you cannot leave your house due to different reasons?
Title: Choose alternatives to the screen Content: While spending your time on Facebook or having video conferences on Zoom might seem the best idea for the days when you stay at home, there are actually other activities even more enriching that would make you happy. Reading books or magazines, working on a puzzle are just a few examples: try to combine your need of staying on the phone with activities that relax both your eyes and brain.
