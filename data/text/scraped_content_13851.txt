Title: Flexibility with remote work Content: Usually, working from home is about flexibility. Every single person will have a different schedule, which will make them more productive.
Title: Early risers and night owls Content: Early risers may work from 5 a.m. to 7 a.m., take a break to get kids sorted for school, then start work again at 8:30 a.m and be finished by 2:30 p.m.Some may sleep in and only start working around 10 a.m. They may stop at 3 p.m. and work again between 10 p.m and 1 a.m. when the house is quiet.It's not always a matter of early versus late. Some people work longer hours on some days to give themselves a break on other days. It's all a matter of fitting work into your lifestyle and when you're most productive.
Title: Batching for productivity Content: Batching is a common productivity strategy - group similar tasks together so your brain doesn't tire with too much context switching.For example, to break your day into three-to four-hour work sessions with two- to three-hour breaks or naps in between. That way, you can focus on specific tasks during each session.
Title: Once-off weird schedules Content: Not everyone follows unusual schedules all the time. Many work a standard 9 to 5. But working from home allows you to adjust your schedule on any given day.
Title: Keeping up with your colleagues Content: With all the flexibility comes the responsibility to keep your calendar up to date, so your coworkers will know when you're available.As long as your changing schedule doesn't take a toll on you or your coworkers' productivity, it's a great way to create a healthy work-life balance.
