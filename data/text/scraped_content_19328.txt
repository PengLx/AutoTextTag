The next day the horse came back bringing seven wildHorses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, "Oh, isn't that lucky.What a great turn of events.You now have eight horses!" The farmer again said, "Maybe."The following day his son tried to break one of theHorses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.The neighbors then said, "Oh dear, that's too bad, " and the farmer responded, "Maybe." The next day the conscription officers came around toConscript people into the army,And they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.Again all the neighbors came around and said, "Isn't that great!" Again, he said, "Maybe."The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immenseComplexity, and it's really impossible to tell whether anything thatHappens in it is good or bad â€” because you never know what will beThe consequence of the misfortune; or,You never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.
