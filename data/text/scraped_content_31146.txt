Title: Productive conversations Content: The practice of open and constructive conversation does not happen naturally, but we can improve it in just about any dialogue.We can wait. Being silent before the other person speaks can contribute to language development in children, learning among students, and problem-solving by teams.
Title: Waiting for children to speak Content: There is a difference between talking to and talking with a child.The developmental gain in language and literacy skills has more to do with the quality of the talk than the quantity of words heard by a child. Taking turns to speak gives the child space and time to speak and receive feedback.
Title: Waiting for students to speak Content: In a 1986 paper, research showed that teachers gave students typically 1 second or less to reply to a question, while the threshold for positive effects turns out to be 2.7 seconds. Giving students more time to respond changed students' attitudes and behavior, and increased the number of questions and unprompted contributions by students.Deliberately increasing wait times also contributes positively to the teacher's attitudes and behavior by forming more cohesive and constructive development of ideas, probing for clarification of elaboration, and encouraging fair expectations across a group of students.
Title: Waiting for colleagues to speak Content: There is evidence that the performance of teams in solving intellectual problems is linked with well-timed talk.  A 1998 study found that groups generally outperformed individuals by listening to and questioning each other's contributions.
