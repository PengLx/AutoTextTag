Title: Being misunderstood Content: You have a set of characteristics and a set of beliefs about you that has become your norm. Other people also have a set of beliefs about themselves and their lives. When you make a change to yourself, big or small, those around you will not fully understand or agree with you because:you're not the same they're used to;you're conflicting with their own set of beliefs.
Title: Any change can cause conflict Content: You don't have to do anything wrong; you just have to change. Youâ€™ll be teased, made fun of, joked about, frowned upon, mocked, or end up being excluded.People around you may simply react to you for being different from themselves or the group. They still care about you, but just want the old you back and the group's identity to remain the same.
Title: Hindering progress Content: The downside of a misunderstanding is that every tease, mock, or remark, regardless of how serious or mild it is, will affect you and question your choices.The beginning is the hardest part when you'll need the most energy to avoid going back to your old self. For some, that's how the journey ends. Trying another time will be much harder because they'll also have the past failure to deal with.
