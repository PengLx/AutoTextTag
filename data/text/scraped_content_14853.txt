Title: Communication in a remote setting Content: Communication and collaboration are already complex issues, further complicated by remote working.Team workers sitting in different time zones and work never happens at the same time. Real-time communication like video conferencing is great but cannot be done the whole day. Email is limited in its collaborative features.
Title: Best practices for asynchronous communication Content: The setting of clear processes, with clear intentions and less clutter.Most things arenâ€™t urgent, and we need to work by thoughtfully communicating.Making your writing refined, polite, and contextual works wonders.Give all the information at once while in a remote working environment.
Title: Real-Time Vs. Asynchronous Communication Content: Real-time communication, like a Video chat, works well for casual hangouts, catch-ups, celebrations, urgent situations and one-on-one meetings.Real-time communication is necessary to get things done fast, and for visibility. The lesser, timid employees are at a disadvantage in real-time communication.Asynchronous communication is inclusive and democratic, as it provides everyone with a chance to communicate in the same way and be heard.
