Title: Gossiping Content: It is talking about a person who isn’t present. It's not necessarily about spreading malicious rumors or embarrassing stories, just sharing information.Research indicates that the typical person spends about 52 minutes per day gossiping. But most of it is just sharing information about the people in their lives with those around them.
Title: Gossip as a Tool Content: Gossiping is a fundamental human instinct because our lives are deeply rooted in groups and we depend on the people in our groups to survive.We need to have as much information as possible about the people around us in order to accurately determine expectations, trustworthiness, viewpoints, and so on.
Title: The Benefits Of Gossip Content: Gossip doesn’t only teach us about the person who’s the subject of the conversation, but also about the gossiper. When you gossip you tell others things about your attitudes, beliefs, and ways of dealing with people by seeing who and what you gossip about.When you do join in, gossip can also strengthen your social bonds.It improves a group's cooperation and makes members less selfish, as well as a way of identifying and ostracizing untrustworthy individuals until they learn the lesson.
Title: The Negative Side Of Gossip Content: Some gossiping has negative consequences for the target or the gossiper, such as if the target finds out, or if listeners conclude that the gossiper is an untrustworthy busybody who can't mind his or her own business.
