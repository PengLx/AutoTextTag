Title: Shame Affects Our Mental Health Content: Shame is that uncomfortable sensation we feel in our stomach when we realize our irrationality and cannot run away from the judging eye of other people. It usually happens when we violate the social norms that we and the community we live in, value.Shame is a universal emotion, its affect on mental health and behaviour are not fully known, and new studies point out that it has a strong link with depression.
Title: Women And Children Feel Shame More Intensely Content: Women and adolescents are quick to feel the negative effects of shame, and dive into low self-esteem and depression at a much faster rate than men.Young people have a stronger ‘pull’ towards any kind of emotion, including shame, which is the reason for them being susceptible to severe depression.The propensity of shame decreases as we grow older, but elders again start to feel ashamed just as a young person, as they get self-conscious of their actions, appearance and bodily decline.
Title: Shame And Guilt Content: Guilt is related to shame but is easier to rectify, as we focus our attention on the other person and apologize, accepting responsibility.Shame is an inward emotion that makes us view our entire self in a bad light, with us getting punished by our conscience.Guilt is actually a positive emotion, showing our empathy and encouraging us to reverse the harm that we may have done.
