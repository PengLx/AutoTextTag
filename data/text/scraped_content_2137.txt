Title: Take a break Content: Think about your life. What is really important to you?How would you like to live your life?Write down the things that are truly important to you, the things that ten years from now will make you proud.Keep the list between 3 - 5 items.
Title: The things you are doing every day Content: Write them down. For example, wake up, eat breakfast, go to work…Highlight the tasks that you do daily that are in line with your priorities.The highlighted stuff is the important stuff that you do every day. Everything else is urgent.
Title: Cut down on the urgent stuff Content: Some “urgent” activities will just need to go. Maybe you can wait until later after all to check your picture on Facebook.Some “urgent” activities will need to be delegated. Your assistant, if you have one, could actually pay that bill. Some others will be better organized. You could actually make a batch of lunches every Sunday and Wednesday.
Title: Run a test week Content: Try your new life for one weekto see in practice what works for you, and then make appropriate changes.It might take you a couple of weeks to clear the clutter from your life, testing what activities should go, stay, be delegated, or better organized.
Title: Add the important stuff Content: Put in your schedule activities that match your priorities. Make sure they are feasible.For example, if you feel you still don’t have enough time to go to the gym for an hour, then don’t put that in your schedule.Start by doing something that is in the vicinity of where you are but in the direction of where you want to go.For example, if 20-30 minutes of daily exercise is your plan for a better health, but you are currently at point zero, then start with 5 minutes.
