Title: Single and happy Content: According to a study in Applied Research Quality of Life, single people tend to be happier than the married ones, as they are more socially active.Therefore, it is these very social interactions that contribute to single people’s increasing happiness, as they spend more time with their social circles. 
Title: Social capital and happiness Content: The so-called ‘social capital’ is perceived by the singles as a substitute for the affection that a life partner is to provide.More than that, for individuals who have recently gone through a divorce or the loss of love of any kind, social interactions seem to have particular importance, as they become a synonym for the support that they need in order to deal with the current difficulties. 
Title: Friends and your happiness Content: All in all, making sure that you keep your circle close to you, especially when you are single, can make a significant difference in your quality of life, as you are going to feel happier whenever you are surrounded by your friends, relatives and so on.So stay positive: being in a couple or choosing to stay single can result in the very same amount of happiness whatsoever.
