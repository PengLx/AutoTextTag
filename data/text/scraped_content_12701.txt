Title: Losing your fitness Content: One of the hot training topics these days is how quickly you lose fitness when your workouts are reduced.But you could also lose fitness faster because of what's going on in your head.
Title: Mental fatigue Content: A paper published in 2009 called "Mental fatigue impairs physical performance in humans" showed thatif the people do something that causes mental fatigue (computer games in this case) and then exercises, the perception of effort during physical exercise seems much higher than if there was less or no mental fatigue. Those who suffer from mental fatigue are likely to quit 15 percent earlier during training.
Title: Performance changes Content: Professional athletes do not suffer to the same extend amateurs do.Elite athletes require a bigger dose of mental fatigue before their performance suffers, perhaps because they build up a functional immunity to mental fatigue. But when it happens, apossible solution could be to taper of mentally before competitions or perhaps special brain endurance training.
