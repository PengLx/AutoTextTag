Title: Mind Replay Content: While we sleep, our brain is on to housekeeping. It is weeding through the experiences of the day and identifying stuff that needs to be put into long-term storage.A new study which involved implanting subjects with Brain-Computer interfaces (BCI) proves that the brain is mentally replaying the day’s activities.
Title: The Mind At Work Content: During the day, all our senses are busy collecting information, which includes sights, smells and sounds.When we sleep, the new memory traces are consolidated and ‘de-fragmented’ into a permanent form of long-term storage, combining the recent experience with existing semantic memory networks. This also proves that when we sleep after learning something, we tend to remember it better as it gets processed and digested inside our minds.
