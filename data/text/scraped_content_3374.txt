Title: Decide What You Want Content: Waiting around often means you’re not happy with any of the options, because they’re not right for who you are.So, when you find yourself stuck between possibilities, think about what you really want.For example, if you’re unsure about a career change, ask yourself what it is that appeals to you about your current position and the one you’re debating.
Title: Being “Supposed To" Choose Something Content: If you’re feeling pressured into making the decision that looks good, step back and examine your reasoning.If you can’t come up with a good answer, you know it’s not for you.
Title: Do Something Content: Remember that doing something trumps doing nothing.For example, instead of being afraid of choosing the wrong job and suffering through the same job you have been hating for years, imagine taking a job that is not the ideal, but giving your all and building on it. This will help you advance, lead projects and develop your skills and resume. You'll be more at ease to change jobs at that point.
Title: Practice Being Decisive Content: If you’re chronically indecisive, build your decision-making muscle by starting small.Give yourself 30 seconds to decide what you’ll have for dinner, what movie to watch, or whether you want to go out tonight. Follow through on that decision. Repeat. Then work up to bigger things.
