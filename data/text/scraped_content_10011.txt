Title: ASMR Content: Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) refers to a sensation which is like a combination of a tingling sensation, pleasure and relaxation. It is a relaxed trance-like state which has been associated with the crackling, popping and squishing sounds of slime videos, providing an insight into why these videos are popular.
Title: Slime Safety Content: The extreme popularity also led to a few accidents with kids using the Slime Glue which had the laundry additive borax, which can sometimes be mixed wrongly, leading to chemical burns. This led to a shift towards ‘borax-free’ slime recipes.
