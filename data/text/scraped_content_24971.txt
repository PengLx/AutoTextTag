Title: The difficulty of behavioral goals Content: Behavioral goals are hard to reach because they usually roll around conflicting desires. Something in you wants to achieve the goal, while something else in you wants to undermine it.
Title: Grit, determination and victory Content: The traditional approach to goal accomplishment revolves around the idea of winning most of our inner conflicts. Grit and determination are emphasized as the keys to victory and the positive side should always win.This approach assumes that there is within us a stockpile of willpower that gives us the power we need to act constantly toward our long-term interests; if we can’t seem to do that, the failing is as much a moral one as a practical one.
Title: Conventional striving doesn't always work Content: Striving isn’t the only strategy when it come to reaching your goals.Try tracking your behavior without particularly striving to change it. This way, you commit only to tracking the relevant numbers (money spent, calories consumed, miles walked, pages read/written, etc.)
