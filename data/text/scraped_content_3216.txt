Quotas make each day approachable, and your goals become achievable.
Title: Behavior chains Content: Creating new habits that stick is easier if we make use of our current routines, instead of trying to fight them.Use "if-then planning": choose a regular part of your schedule and then build another “link in the chain” by adding a new habit. For example: "If it is lunch time, then I will only eat meat and vegetables.”
Title: Simplify decision-making Content: Making repeated choices depletes our mental energy, even if these choices are mundane and pleasant.If you want to maintain long term discipline, aim for fewer decisions during the day: identify the aspects of your life that you consider mundane and then ‘routinize’ those aspects as much as possible.

New habits are often very fragile, and it is for this reason that we must eliminate any source of friction that may lead us astray.
