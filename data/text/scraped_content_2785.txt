Title: Relate Content: It's important to be sincere when you hand out words of wisdom, as well as find a way to make things connect in the brain of your audience.  Advice will go in one ear and out the other if your audience can't relate.
Title: Know your audience Content: Take note of your audience's preferred method of reasoning and decision making, then tailor your advice accordingly.
Title: Use analogies Content: Avoid long, descriptive explanations and break things down with simple analogies. Use analogies based around common knowledge or things you know your audience would be knowledgeable about.
Title: Obtain context Content: Investigate the problem and ask questionsto get as much information as you can.  You can't give good advice when you're missing pieces of the puzzle.
