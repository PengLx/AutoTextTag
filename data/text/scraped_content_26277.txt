Title: Waking Up Late Means Moving Less Content: Rising early in the day makes an overall difference in the number of steps one walks during the entire day, with the late risers moving around less.Each of us has a master internal body clock in our brains, along with many smaller cellular clocks that track and absorb outside information. The master clock then makes the necessary body changes, like releasing hormones and chemicals that affect our alertness, hunger and sleep.
Title: Our Chronotype Content: Our various biochemical signals, daily lifestyle, and genetic inclinations develop a specific chronotype in us, that is basically our overall biological response to the outside world.These chronotypes are categorized as: Morning, Day or Night. The person with a morning chronotype will wake up early in the morning and start to feel hungry sooner than the person with a Day or Night chronotype.
Title: The Body Rhythm Content: The chronotypes we form are not permanent in most cases but have a rhythm of their own, spawning years, and shifting from Morning to Day and eventually, Night, based on our age.People with chronotypes that are more towards the evening are more prone to various metabolic disorders and are likely to develop obesity, diabetes and heart disease.
Title: Warning For The Night Owls Content: A major study in the University of Oulu, Finland showed that people with the morning chronotype moved for about 20 to 30 minutes more than those with the other chronotypes.This study suggests that people who stay up late and eventually wake up late need to take their exercise routines more seriously.
