Health,Habits
Title: Avoiding caffeine Content: Don't drink caffeine after dark. If you have your last coffee in the early afternoon, most of the caffeine will have been flushed out of your body by 11pm.Although avoiding coffee or tea within 6 hours of going to bed will make it much easier to drop off, it is unclear whether there are any benefits to abstaining outside that time period.
Title: Sleeping diary Content: Keeping a sleep diary of your activity before bed, which helps to ensure you avoid the worst triggers.You should avoid doing anything strenuous or stressful within a few hours of sleep time
Title: Reading devices Content: Many e-readers are backlit with blue frequencies of light, which can fool the brain into thinking that it’s still daytime. Reading on these devices for a few hours before bed seems to suppress melatonin (the sleep hormone) and therefore makes it harder to doze off, compared to a traditional paperback. The same goes for tablets, MP3 players and smartphones.
Title: “Slumber-foods” Content: Meals high in carbohydrates and protein (especially oily fish), but low in fat, show moderate benefits to overall sleep duration and quality, **provided they are eaten at least 1 hour before you plan to sleep.**
Title: Changing sleeping positions Content: Many restless nights can be linked to sleep apnoea – a condition linked to snoring, in which the airways becomes constricted when you are unconscious. There are several causes, but some cases may be easily solved by switching from lying on your back, to sleeping on your front or side.
