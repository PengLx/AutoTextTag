Title: Inflammation as a body response Content: Inflammation occurs naturally in the body as part of the body’s immune response: when your body is fighting an infection or injury, it sends inflammatory cells to the rescue. Things change if inflammation lingers without fully going away. This means your body is always in a state of high alert, and it can trigger major health issues, including (heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer).
Title: Anti-Inflammatory Diet Content: Filling your meals with foods known to fight inflammation and cutting out foods known to contribute to it. Ideally, you would eat 7 to 9 servings of fruits and veggies per day, limit your intake of red meat and dairy, choose complex carbohydrates over simple ones, and swear off processed foods.You’ll want to choose foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids.
