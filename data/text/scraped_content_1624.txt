Title: Accidentally insulting someone Content: Maybe you sent a text or email to the wrong person that included a less than positive opinion of the person who just received it.Don’t make up an excuse or try to backtrack; a candid conversation will lead to forgiveness much faster than a bunch of BS.Apologize only if you care. And if you don’t like someone, use the mistake to get them out of your life.
Title: The lazy coworker Content: If you’re working with someone who isn’t pulling their weight, the key to solving this issue is to not give them too many chances.Explain to your coworker that the project is important to you, and you want to make sure you both see things the same way. Also, talk about your needs instead of their faults.
Title: Awkward conversations Content: At a party or conference where small talk with someone nearby becomes awkward:excuse yourself to get a drink/coffee.say “It’s nice talking to you, but I have to talk to someone before they leave.”if your conversation is on the phone, end it by saying, “I’d love to catch up, but I have somewhere to be.”
Title: Quitting your job Content: The key to handling this awkward situation is letting your supervisor know it’s you and not them. Tell your boss you’ve found a job that allows you to learn something new. Focus on what the new job offers and how it will help you accomplish your goals instead of what your current job lacked.
Title: Working for a bad boss Content: Figure out the real issue before you speak to your supervisor.Instead of “You’re difficult,” say “It’s difficult for me to do my job well when I’m not given updated information.”Don’t be afraid to ask questions about things that are your responsibility.And if this doesn’t help, ask a trusted colleague if others are having the same issue. There can be power in numbers if everyone comes forward with the same complaint.
