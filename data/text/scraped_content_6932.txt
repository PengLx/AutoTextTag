Title: The so-called 'FOMO' Content: FOMO (fear of missing out) refers to almost everything that, as humans, we have always been afraid to miss out on: luxurious travels, expensive goods, delicious food.While dealing with the current pandemic, we can finally take a break from this fear, as no one has all the above-mentioned experiences or items anymore. Everybody is stuck in their house now, doing home office or nothing at all.
Title: Use your time wisely Content: During this tough period we are all currently facing, there is a positive aspect worth being taken into account: staying isolated at home can provide us with unique chances.For instance, we can now use this time to spend endless hours with our family or doing all the things we have so much wanted to do for the longest time and have never had the chance to do, because work would always come first.
