Title: Our inability to focus Content: Two significant challenges are destroying our ability to focus.We are increasingly overwhelmed with distractions from various connected devices.We rely excessively on meetings as the default form of interaction with other people at work. Studies reveal that we spend 35% -55% of our time on meetings.We need to set aside more time if we want to remain focused and productive at work.
Title: Practice mindfulness Content: Our biggest mistake is how we start the day. Instead of checking email on your phone, try a simple mindfulness practice when you wake up.It can be quietly taking a few deep breaths or meditating for 20 to 30 minutes.
Title: Organize tasks Content: A common mistake is to fill your calendar with the wrong tasks.A meeting can break your day into two pieces, each too small to do anything hard in. Instead, take advantage of your body's natural rhythms. Focus on complex, creative tasks in the morning and schedule your meetings for the afternoon.
Title: Clean up Content: Your environment affects your productivity and quality of work. Don't let yourself get distracted by clutter.To help you stay focused, take the time to clean up your work environment, both physical and digital.
Title: Shrink meetings Content: Limit the number of people in any meeting to eight or fewer,  unless the meeting is informational.Ensure that your meetings result in action items, a timeline for each action item, and one person who is responsible.
Title: Preserve buffers Content: Switching tasks and context is difficult. You cannot be efficient if you run from meeting to meeting. If you want to avoid wasting time, add buffer time between each meeting.For every 45 - 60 minutes you spend in a meeting, take 15 minutes to process, reflect, and prioritize.
