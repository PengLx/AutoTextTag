Title: Challenges To Listening Content: We have many things screaming for our attention every minute of the day and we often trick ourselves into believing they’re more important than a conversation unfolding right in front of us.We have a biological challenge, too: We can listen about three times faster than anyone can talk. That means we have excess capacity in our brain that will wander off and entertain itself unless we take steps to intentionally manage it.
Title: The Importance Of Proper Listening Content: With proper listening you’ll have a crystal clear understanding of the conversation and demonstrate to speakers that you’re invested in what they have to say.Being a good listener is one of the most potent things you can do to increase your influence and likeability. It is also one of the top skills employers seek in potential and current employees, and it’s correlated with perceived ability to lead.
Title: How To Be A Better Listener Content: Push other activities from your mind, and be present in the discussion. This tells the other person that you’re ready for the conversation.Keep a neutral expression that simply says, “I’m listening.” We tend to physically react to what we hear and it disrupts our ability to listen and the other person’s ability to be heard.Offer uninterrupted speaking time. Well-intended or not, interruptions makes effective communication impossible.Repeat back succinctly and ask validating questions to make sure you heard the speaker correctly.
