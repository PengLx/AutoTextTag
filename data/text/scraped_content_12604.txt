Then, think reasonably about the cause of your behaviour and calm down as much as possible. Furthermore, be compassionate towards yourself: for every single issue there is a solution.
Title: Be compassionate Content: When the ones around you lose their patience and start taking it out on you regarding things only they are responsible for, show compassion.
