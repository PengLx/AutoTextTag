Title: Put everything in its place Content: We don't have to live with clutter. We also don't have to live with limited personal items. There is a middle ground: put everything in its place.When your stuff doesn't have a place, it feels juke junk because you approach it like junk, eventually throwing it out like junk. All it needs is to be put in its place.
Title: Organizing clutter Content: Clutter has less to do with what you have and more with where it goes.Use your given limits.Prioritize a place for your important things.You will then see what doesn't belong in your home simply because it doesn't have a place.
