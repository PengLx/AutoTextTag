Title: Content vs. Process Content: A lot of people feel that learning "content" in schools is not as valuable as it once was, they often refer to the "doctor analogy""I want to know that my doctor did really well in school and thoroughly understand the practice of medicine.."People would be rest assured knowing that their doctor knows how the process works than know what the process is.
Title: Tacit Knowledge â‰  Explicit Knowledge Content: Tacit Knowledge is defined as the "know how" (process) rather than "know what" (content). A part of it could be codified into explicit knowledge. However, it is often difficult to explain just by writing it down. It is something you learn by doing.Explicit Knowledge, on the other hand, refers to information we see on the books or the internet.Although there's a difference, one is not dependable without the other.
Title: Building Trust While Learning Content: A shift to focusing on more process in our classrooms will inevitably have some risk, that is why it is essential that we create an environment that builds trust.Trust is necessary because of the unavoidable fumbling that occurs as we try to express and share tacit knowledge. Without it, we may lack respect for the other needed to stay with them as they fumble.
Title: Content + Process = Success Content: We have to realize that content and process binds each other. For us to be successful, we need to have knowledge, but more importantly, know how to put it to work.And even though "knowledge" is at the lowest end of Bloom's Taxonomy, it is still an essential component of how we start learning and realizing things.
