Title: The hedonic treadmill Content: The hedonic treadmill is the tendency to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness after a major positive or negative event or life change.You want something because you think itâ€™ll make you happy. But when you get what you want, the new thing will only make you happy for a short while before you revert to your earlier, less happy state.
Title: Recognize the signs Content: Almost everyone experiences the hedonic treadmill. It's a trap and makes you think that a salary raise, a new car, or a new house or career will give you lasting happiness. Those events may make us happy, but only for a short time.If we can learn to recognize the signs and build better habits, we can be happy and content for longer.
Title: Healthy habits Content: Instead of waiting for major life changes, invest in healthy habits that can guarantee satisfaction in life.Choose activities like writing, playing music, creating art, or practicing a sport that allows you to savor the moment fully. Other people enjoy endeavors like volunteering and charity work.
Title: Happiness is a state of mind Content: Happiness is not out there for us to find; it's within us. It's in what we do, how we act, how we think.We have the potential to be happy when we choose to focus on what matters.
