Title: Journal Writing As Healing Content: Expressive writing, or daily journaling of life events, feelings, emotions and thoughts, is a kind of therapy that improves our mental health, as we do not let life pile up, giving it space, distance and shape while reflecting on it. It acts as a vent to our sadness and deep-rooted pain, providing acceptance, and eventually healing.Life writing can be a diary, journal, oral testimony, memoir or an autobiography, though personal essays or memoirs prove to be the most therapeutic.
