Title: Strategies speed readers use Content: Skimming:quickly going through passages to find the main points.Meta guiding uses a pointer, such as your index finger or a pen, to guide your eyes along the lines of text.The vision span method uses the span of human eyesight to read words in batches.Rapid serial visual representation (RSVP): an electronic reading system displays words one at a time.
Title: Effectiveness of Speed Reading Content: Regardless of which reading method you use, the evidence points towards the fact that speed comes at the sacrifice of understanding.Depending on what you’re reading, this might not necessarily be a bad thing:If you’re trying to get through a dry piece to capture a few key points or you aregoing through a short piece that’s easy to understand, speed reading strategies might make sense.
Title: Make the most of what you read Content: Choose different reading pieces for different occasions:articles and light reads can be reserved for short periods. Books that require less focus can be listened to in audio format etc.Incorporate reading into your daily habit:put a book on your bedside table.Share your reads with others, to help you to better understand and appreciate what you read.Reflect on your reading: take notes or check out films that are based on novels (to compare interpretations).
