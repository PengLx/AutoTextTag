Title: The Bees and the symphony of life Content: Against every choice of destruction, there is always the choice of creation.This is the message of Poet Audre Lorde, as she draws on bees to describe the alternative to destruction. Her poem describes young boys throwing stones at swarming bees. A boy gets stung by a bee, and consequently, school guards destroy the hive. Afterward, a girl observed that the bees were not making trouble. Instead of destroying the hive, the children could've studied honey-making instead.
