They lessen the dayâ€™s anxiety, provide a structure to power-through and are written proof of our productivity.As the Zeigarnik Effect proves, we obsess over unfinished tasks and remember stuff which is incomplete or pending. The To-Do list comes to the rescue and saves us from a lot of stress.

Here are some ways to make them more effective:List entries should be detailed, having a clear purpose.Paper and pen lists, preferably in a dairy, work best.Make the work schedule realistic, factoring in all the time that is wasted gossiping or on social media.Do not list heavy, unworkable projects(A: Climb Mount Everest) as they would never be done.
