Title: Fear of moving abroad Content: Any decision as big as moving abroad is bound to spark fear:The timing will never feel perfect. It will always be hard to leave family and friends, and your career will always be in flux.But if you wait for your fears to somehow fade away, you might be waiting forever.
Title: Plan in advance Content: Carefulplanning can cancel out many of the common fears around moving abroad, including fears about your career or the fear of being lonely.The movie-like approach of "pick a place you think you might like, save money, buy a one-way ticket and hope that you will get a job once you are there" might not work for you if you are held out by fears.
Title: Be realistic  Content: There is always a chance that moving abroad won't work out as you imagined.Realize that this won't be the end of the world. You can always go back home, or you can always move to another city or country. This is not your only shot, and if you decide your new home isn't for you, it's perfectly okay to reconsider.
Title: Build your network in advance Content: There is always a period of loneliness when you move.Planning before leaving will help with that: Reach out to people you came in contact with while searching for jobs, contact your alumni office and ask for a list of people who live in your new city or join Facebook groups for expats living in your new home.
