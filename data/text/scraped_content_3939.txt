Title: 4 Principles for Effective & Clear Communication Content: Start off in the right place:explain the information in terms that they already understandDon't explain too much: focus on the bigger pictureGo for clarity over accuracy: being extremely accurate isn't that important as being clear, concise and simpleExplain your motivation: Why are you saying what you are saying
Title: Start In The Right Place Content: Everyone's got a different background, everyone's got a different set of knowledge, and it's our job to explain the information in terms that they already understand.As you start to explain, ask questions like "Is this making any sense?" And don't worry too much about whether you're telling the audience something they've already heard before.
Title: Don't Explain Too Much Content: Focus on the bigger picture, instead of explaining in length every nitty-gritty detail, which people will find hard to absorb.Too much information can dilute your message.
Title: Clarity Over Accuracy Content: Being extremely accurate isn't that important as being clear, concise and simple.A basic understanding of a concept, if done right, can later be built upon for a more comprehensive picture.
Title: Explain Your Motivation Content: Personalize your subject by letting the listener know why you think it is cool.Show your enthusiasm, and your motivation. They are contagious.
