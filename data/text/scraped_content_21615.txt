Communication,Personal Development,Love & Relationships
Title: Challenging our assumptions Content: We often make assumptions about others based on the way they look.The person who may seem unsociable and grumpy may not be that way at all. But we can only find that out once we make an effort to reach out and talk to him or her.
Title: Increasing our listening skills Content: The best way to talk to strangers is to ask for their opinion on a matter. People love expressing their views. We can then focus our attention on what they say and use it to discover further what they think.Asking open-ended questions is the key to developing this type of communication.
Title: Moving out of our comfort zone Content: The more challenging we find it to talk to strangers, the more we will grow in that area when we take action, and the easier it will become.When we challenge ourselves and move out of our comfort zone, we experience personal growth.
Title: Boosting our self-awareness Content: Speaking to strangers reveal things about ourselves. We may be reminded of someone we had a negative experience with. Our assumptions about the other person may be completely wrong. But we will not know this unless we make an effort to learn more about the person.
Title: Enhancing our empathy Content: Showing an interest in the lives of strangers increases our awareness of the struggles other people have. We become aware of something beyond our own immediate needs and interests, which in turn decreases the feelings of isolation.
