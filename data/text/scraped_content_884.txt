Title: Chunking - The Root of Habits Content: The process in which the brain converts a sequence of actions into an automatic routine is known as ‘chunking,’ and it’s at the root of how habits form.
Title: Habits emerge... Content: ...because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort.It will try to make almost any routine into a habit, because habits allow our minds to ramp down more often. This effort-saving instinct is a huge advantage.
Title: The 3 Step Loop of Habit Formation: Content: First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use.Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional.Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future.
Title: Habits and brain functioning Content: When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making.It stops working so hard, or diverts focus to other tasks. So unless you deliberately fight a habit, unless you find new routines, the pattern will unfold automatically.
Title: The Golden Rule of habit change Content: A habit cannot be eradicated—it must, instead, be replaced. And if we keep the same cue and the same reward, a new routine can be inserted.But that’s not enough. For a habit to stay changed, people must believe change is possible. And most often, that belief only emerges with the help of a group.
