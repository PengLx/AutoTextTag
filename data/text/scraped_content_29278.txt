Title: Becoming Young Content: Being young is being curious. And most people become cynical and overly critical towards life as they grow older, and only a select few retain the wonder, innocence and joy of a child.An adult's life consists of optimizing life using knowledge, mental models and practical shortcuts, a race towards better efficiency in everything. We stop asking the right questions, like the most common question a child asks: Why?
Title: Our Inner Critic Content: Our inner critic is usually formed in a system based on right and wrong answers and outperforming others on structured tasks. Listening to our inner critic will rarely improve our creative work - it may actually result in conformative work.We need to turn this inner-critic into an inner-coach and drive our personal growth.
Title: Re-educating Our Inner Critic Content: We do not need to suppress or kill our inner critic, but only need to re-educate it, but only need to deploy three simple ways to make space for the inner child:Get more playful in our creative endeavours.Skip doing something adults do in favour of doing something that kids love to do, like drawing, writing poems and playing in the pool.Practice constructive questioning by asking why to the things we (and others) take for granted.
