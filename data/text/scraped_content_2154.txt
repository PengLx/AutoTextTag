Title: FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) Content: FOMO is the experience of worrying that other people are doing more interesting things than you, have more friends than you, and are just all around living a better and cooler life.The prime source of FOMO is of course social media, which allows you to peruse the highlights of other people’s lives in real time.
Title: What you really wish to do Content: Choosing one path means missing another.When you feel FOMO coming on, ask yourself if the trigger is really something you wish you were doing yourself, or if the sudden recollection of the great number of choices in life has simply brought on a moment of insecurity about your own.If it’s the latter, taking a moment to reaffirm your decision is all it takes to chase the FOMO away.
Title: The need for a change Content: Keep in mind that your FOMO trigger may not relate directly to something you wish you were doing yourself, but can instead point more broadly to something you want to change about your life.Examine the source of your FOMO before dismissing it; there may be a good reason you feel insecure about your decisions.
Title: What is viable for you right now Content: Embrace the idea of different seasons in your life.If there’s something from a previous season in your life that you once enjoyed but doesn’t fit into it right now, instead of spending your time worried about what you’re missing out on, make the most of the uniqueness of your current season.
Title: Representation of reality Content: What you see online is a groomed and sanitized image of someone else’s life. Measuring the entirety of your life against this cherry-picked peek of another’s is a recipe for feeling inadequate.
Title: Use technology wisely Content: Social media outlets are merely tools – ones that can add or detract from your life depending on whether or not you deploy them wisely.Set a certain time limit for using it each day.Filter who you see in your news feed to those you actually care about.Don’t be friends with your ex-girlfriends on Facebook.Don’t engage in a FOMO arms race.
