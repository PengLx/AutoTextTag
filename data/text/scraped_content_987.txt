Title: Tracking expenses Content: One of the ugly truths about budgeting is that when you keep track of your expenses, it’s painfully clear when you’ve gone off track.Write it down when you’ve gone over your budget. The negativity you feel will help prevent you from overspending more or doing it again. Just think of this step as damage control. 
Title: Being frugal and miserable Content: If you try to deprive yourself too much, you’ll binge later and throw all your hard work out the window.A spending binge can set you back far more than treating yourself occasionally, so go for the occasional minor splurge. Just keep your treats within your spending limits and you’ll be fine.
