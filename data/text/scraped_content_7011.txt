Title: Being Authentic Content: Not everyone achieves top-level success. There is far too much competition, noise and fragmentation in the world for everyone to shine through.A lot of people are unique and highly skilled, but not everyone makes it. The key to being seen and heard in this noise is to be genuine, authentic and able to express your true self.
Title: Recreate, Reinvent Content: When something is clearly not working, it makes sense to pivot, recreate and reinvent it. We need to keep our ego aside and internalize all the lessons you have learned due to failure.One should always take a hard, honest look at one’s life, not being afraid to change one’s course.
Title: Open Up and Show Yourself Content: Showing your vulnerability, sincerity, and honesty isn’t comfortable, but is a sign of courage. Truthful and sincere people shine like the sun and can be spotted easily in this noisy world.Being able to talk about failure and your weaknesses makes you human and also inspires the people around you. When you come across as relatable, warm and flawed, it acts as a silver foil over your skillsets.
Title: Amuse Yourself Content: Life is not to be taken too seriously. Not everything will be like the way you want it to be.Make it your playground.There will be blunders, mistakes, miscalculations, and some disastrous days as well. The trick is to not let anything get to you, and have fun with every moment, enjoying it to the fullest.
Title: The Truth Serum Content: Simply live life wholeheartedly and money, fame, status are just some of the things you will experience. If you are authentic, no matter what happens, you are a success by default.
