Title: Nostalgia Reloaded Content: Pop culture, be it movies, music or TV series, is increasingly and blatantly relying on the past, and using our feeling of the longing of the past, our nostalgia, to bait us into watching or liking the content.The world, according to many people, is heading towards a wrong and dangerous direction, and we are longing for a less complicated life, trying to find it in the past.
Title: Back To The Future Content: The 1960s and the 70s saw imaginative ‘future’ oriented shows like Star Trek TOS, animated series like the Jetsons, and groundbreaking science fiction stories by gifted writers, most of which turned into blockbuster movies. The world, which was looking forward at that time, is now increasingly looking backwards.
Title: The Nostalgia Paradox Content: The feeling of nostalgia should be high when the present is unpleasant, but this isn't what is happening.  Today’s world offers infinitely better technology, information, and comfort than in the past. We have better civil rights, liberty, and greater opportunities(and options) for a successful life. Still, we hanker for the past, making this a Nostalgia Paradox.
