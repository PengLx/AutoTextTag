Title: Connect With Someone New Content: Connect with someone you haven’t previously interacted with all that much:Sit next to someone you normally wouldn’t in that company-wide meeting. Approach somebody different for a lunch recommendation or input on your project. Reach out and schedule a time to grab coffee with someone you haven’t had a chance to get to know yet.
Title: Call Out Exclusive Behavior Content: Maybe point out that your office’s annual Christmas cookie contest might be excluding those who don’t celebrate the holiday. Or let everyone know that failing to push in their chairs in meeting rooms and around the desks makes it that much tougher for your co-worker in a wheelchair to get around.This will highlight your commitment to inclusivity.
Title: Watch Your Language Content: Your language really makes an impact when it comes to being more inclusive in the workplace.Even if you don’t mean to make anyone uncomfortable, your choice of words can inadvertently make others feel excluded.
Title: Amplify Other People's Ideas Content: ... ratherthan only broadcasting your own.For example, if a co-worker made a great suggestion in a team meeting that you felt was ignored or wasn’t appropriately considered, bring it back around by saying something like, “I found Megan’s idea really interesting and think we should revisit that…”
Title: Don't Be Afraid to Ask Questions Content: Diversity and inclusion can be sensitive topics, and that inspires many people to avoid them altogether. They don’t want to ask the wrong questions or say something that could be perceived as insensitive.Caution and awareness are admirable, but it also means you could be missing out on some awesome information and relationships. So don’t hesitate to ask some questions.
