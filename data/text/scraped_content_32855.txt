Title: Removing caffeine from coffee Content: Coffee beans are first softened in hot water or steam. Then caffeine is dissolved from the beans by using a solvent such as methylene chloride, ethyl acetate, or a gentler solvent such as water itself.Liquid carbon dioxide is a much more expensive alternative, but has the added advantage that it does not remove the flavour molecules.
Title: Adding flavour molecules Content: The solvents used to obtain decaf coffee also remove some of the flavour molecules. These are then added back. One way is to perform a first extraction with water, then shake up the water with a small volume of methylene chloride, or pass it through a charcoal filter. Both processes selectively remove the caffeine from the water but leave most of the flavour molecules.
