Title: Long-term success Content: We often think that we need to have talent and confidence before we can accomplish something.In reality, talent is often overrated. It is small accomplishments that lead to confidence.
Title: Fixed mindset vs. growth mindset Content: People with a fixed mindset think intelligence, character, and creative potential are unchangeable attributes that come from birth. They also assume that success is the result of this inherent talent. They tend to avoid failure to avoid looking fallible.People with a growth mindset do not look at failure as a reflection of their ability, but rather as a starting point for testing ideas.
Title: How you see yourself influences your path in life Content: Research shows that praising a child for their intelligence can be detrimental as they face obstacles differently. Instead, praise your child for their effort.When you believe in innate ability, then you feel you have to prove yourself over and over. Any sort of difficulty creates a desire to give up to keep your "smart" persona intact.
Title: Where talent is still relevant Content: Talent truly matters in two ways:As a head start in the race to mastery. Those who are willing to work hard can still pass you by, therefore the saying: "Hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard."In edge cases. For the best of the best, talent matters more. Talent adds that little extra that takes their hard work to the peak of performance.
Title: Believing in growth: use small wins Content: The key to developing a growth mindset is to "fake it until you make it." It results in small wins, which will lead to real confidence.Start with focusing on small wins by changing your habits. Make daily "micro quotas" such as 10 minutes of working out a day. Once your habit is established, scale it. Over time, this creates a growth mindset - a passion for learning instead of a need for approval.
