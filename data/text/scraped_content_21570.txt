Title: Disagreements with a huge polarizing effect Content: It is common to disagree with peers, friends, family members and even strangers. Normally, it is harmless banter and one gets along fine with people with a different taste in pizza or a basketball team.Certain political, religious, or cultural disagreements have a huge polarizing effect, something which is potent enough to destroy friendships and form lifelong enmity.
Title: Anxiety and threat during heated discussions Content: Divisive topics, especially politics and religion, are by definition loaded with subjectivity and have no worldwide consensus.  This creates an inherent threat in the participant, as the moral, religious, and political values start to lose ground, creating anxiety and extreme reactions, like unfriending or blocking the person having a different point of view.
Title: Different views: right vs wrong Content: Different moral values make the person view the discussion as a right versus wrong or good versus evil fight, in which it is natural to make an enemy out of the other person, who is now being looked at in a different light.
