Title: Procrastination as a coping mechanism Content: People tend to procrastinate to avoid emotionally unpleasant tasks - so they choose to focus on something that provides a temporary mood boost. This creates a vicious cycle: procrastination itself causes shame and guilt — which in turn leads people to procrastinate even further.
Title: The science behind getting started Content: Progress on our goals feeds our well-being. So the most important thing to do is bootstrap a little progress: get a little progress, and that’s going to fuel your well-being and your motivation.
Title: Implementation intentions  for better focus Content: This is a self-regulatory strategy in the form of an "if-then plan": "If the phone rings, then I’m not going to answer it." "If my friends call me to say we’re going out, I’m going to say no." So you’ve already made these pre-commitments.
