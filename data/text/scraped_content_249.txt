Title: Questions about the meaning of life contain assumptions: Content: “What’s the meaning of life?” Assumes that there’s a single meaning.“Does my life have meaning?” Assumes (or at least hints) at a “yes” or “no” answer.
Title: Problems of meaning=problems of insufficient value Content: Those who think life is meaningless feel that there is a gap between their expectations and reality:between the degree of value that life should have and the degree of value that it actually has. -Iddo Landau
