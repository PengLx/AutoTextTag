Title: Know your outcome Content: Figure out your “why.” Consider these questions.What opportunities will become available by learning that new thing?What would you do if you could use your desired skill right now?Will you have a deeper relationship with your family/friends? Grow your business?
Title: Model the best Content: No matter what you want to learn or accomplish, there’s someone in the world that has already achieved what you want.You have access nowadays to endless resources in the form ofbiographies, books, videos, online classes and so on. You just have to search.
Title: Immerse yourself in the process Content: There are no shortcuts.The 10,000 hour rule is still under debate, but it doesn’t defeat the fact that immersion through repetition of the task at hand is the only way to achieve mastery.
Title: Get immediate feedback Content: Seek an outside perspective as soon as possible.We try to learn everything ourselves, without seeking the feedback of others, only to realize that we were way off-course.
Title: Drop what doesn’t work Content: Since our focus is limited, we can maximize our results is to eliminatewhat doesn’t work.The easiest way to do this is to use Pareto’s principle to your task: almost every time, there are a few important tasks that give you the majority of your desired results.
Title: Go long Content: Don’t quit just because you’re not getting the results you desire in this moment.If you have a clear vision, someone to model, and embrace massive experimentation, there’s no reason not to give up.
