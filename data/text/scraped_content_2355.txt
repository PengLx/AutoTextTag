Title: Find common ground Content: After having introduced yourself, you should find something in common that connects you right away.It opens the door to more conversation--and keeping words up is key when you first break the ice with a person.
Title: Move on to deeper topics Content: Although focusing on shallow topics to start--such as the weather or sports or your favorite new film--makes breaking the ice easier, your goal should be to move on to deeper topics as you gain familiarity with the other person.
Title: It takes one joke Content: ... an anecdote, or a well-timed story in order to show other people that you understand them.Perhaps it's a connection about a mutual friend at work or a common breakfast spot you shared growing up. It's the one spark that ends up transforming the interaction from being acquaintance-like to a true friendship.
