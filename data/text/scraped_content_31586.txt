Title: When experience matters the most? Content: A general limitation of the human mind is its imperfect ability to reconstruct past states of knowledge, or beliefs that have changed. Once you adopt a new view of the world (or of any part of it), you immediately lose much of your ability to recall what you used to believe before your mind changed.When the event is happening, we experience it. After that, we remember it. This way, there are our two selves, the experiencing self, and the remembering self.The experiencing self is the one that answers the question: “Does it hurt now?” or “How you feel now?” The remembering self is the one that answers the question: “How was it, on the whole?”Most of the UI Design work majorly focuses on experiencing self. But to make users stick with your products a Designer must take care of remembering self too because remembering self brings users back.
Title: How confident we should be in user research that we have fully understood the problem? Content: Confidence is a feeling, which reflects the coherence of the information and the cognitive ease of processing it. Almost every design case-study makes a coherent story. Is telling a coherent story a symptom that the problem is resolved?“She is a hedgehog. She has a theory that explains everything, and it gives her the illusion that she understands the world.”Designers take pride that they understand the problem and they can solve it just because they have created a well-drawn story.If test data has been collected unbiasedly and that data validates our story, we can be sure of our problem-solving skills. Designers can take pride in their problem-solving skills, not the solutions that they provide to the problem because the world is unpredictable insanely and no single story (or solution) can cover all the possibilities.
