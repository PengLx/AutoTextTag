Title: Psychology vs ethics Content: The main difference between psychology and ethics refers to the end results the two lead to. While what people would do in certain situations, from a psychological point of view is one thing, what they should do is something completely different, which relies more on making the right decisions.
Title: Ask your questions in a different way Content: Whenever you are in need of some advice, pay attention to how you ask the question: using 'should' instead of 'would' will automatically lead to more honesty and involvement from the other person. It is entirely up to you whether you want to appeal to psychology or ethics, so choose your words wisely.
