Title: Lack of prioritization Content: When we’re busy and stressed, we often default to working on whatever has the most imminent deadline, even if it’s not particularly important. Stress causes our focus to narrow to the point where we’re just keeping going.The solution is to step back and work on tasks that are important but not urgent.
Title: Overlooking easy solutions Content: When we’re stressed, our narrow focus blocks us from seeing easy solutions that are usually right in front of our eyes.To get out of the trap of overlooking easy solutions, take a step back and question your assumptions. Taking breaks and letting your mind wander will also help.
Title: Lack of effective systems Content: When we're burned out, we tend to keep doing something ourselves that we could delegate or outsource, because we don’t have the necessary energy we need to establish a system for recurring problems.Remedies for recurring problems are often simple if you can step back enough to get perspective.
Title: Coping mechanisms Content: People who are overloaded will have a strong impulse to avoid or escape anxiety:Avoidance could mean putting off a discussion with your boss.Escape could mean rushing into an important decision, because you want to escape needing to think about it further.Take some time and space towork through your emotions and thoughts when your anxiety is set off.
