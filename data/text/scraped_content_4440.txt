Some people eat in response to boredom or buy stuff in response to their desires.
Title: Trick yourself Content: Take an existing cue you have, but trick yourself into triggering a different behavior.If you want to quit coffee, you could give away the coffee machine and put a box of tea or a glass of water on the countertop.
Title: Make a new reward Content: Try to make a new reward that is similar to the old reward.If it is a coffee habit, the reward is a warm beverage and an excuse to sit still and reflect. For that reason, a substitute like herbal tea would work.
