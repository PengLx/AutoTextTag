Title: The Perfect Partner Content: We expect our partner to be perfect in every way. As we spend our life with our partner, we seem to mistakenly believe that the other person will have everything in common with us and will think the same thought that is occurring in our head, at the same time.If we have unrealistic and comical expectations from our partners, getting irritated at every minor flaw, and having a lofty, movie-like idea of what a relationship is, we won't be happy no matter who we are with.
Title: Essential Things To Look For In a Partner Content: Instead of making relationships complicated and overambitious, we can just take care of these three essential but overlooked aspects:Kindness: A person who is humane and kind, gentle and not too serious.Shared Vulnerability: A person who is a good, empathetic listener, and makes us open comfortably about our anxieties, problems and worries.Understanding: Someone who has a deep understanding of our traits, quirks, features, obsessions, and the way we see the world. Someone who is interesting enough for us to want to understand.
Title: A Simpler Life Content: Paradoxically, by limiting our expectations about our relationship, we can concentrate on the three critical ingredients of kindness, understanding and vulnerability, and have a simple yet loving connection.By simplifying and clarifying, we can release ourselves from our complicated conflicts and pursue a deep and profound bond.
