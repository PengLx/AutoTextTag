Title: Ketosis  Content: ... is a normal metabolic process. When the body does not have enough glucose (derived from sugars and starches) for energy, it burns stored fats instead; this results in a build-up of acids called ketones within the body.
Title: Fast facts on ketosis Content: Ketosis occurs when the body does not have sufficient access to its primary fuel source, glucose.Ketosis describes a condition where fat stores are broken down to produce energy, which also produces ketones, a type of acid.In small amounts, ketones serve to indicate that the body is breaking down fat, but high levels of ketones can poison the body, leading to a process called ketoacidosis,a serious condition that can prove fatal.People with type 1 diabetes are more likely to develop ketoacidosis, for which emergency medical treatment is required to avoid or treat diabetic coma.Some people follow a ketogenic (low-carb) diet to try to lose weight by forcing the body to burn fat stores.
Title: The ketogenic diet Content: The diet itself can be regarded as a high-fat diet, with around 75 % of calories derived from fats, 20 % from proteinsand 5 % from carbohydrates.Adhering to the ketogenic diet can lead to short-term weight loss, consuming fewer calories without feeling hungry while following the diet.
Title: Possible ketosis health benefits Content: These health benefits could be due to the loss of excess weight and eating of healthier foods, rather than a reduction in carbohydrates.Longer-term adherence to the ketogenic diet does not appear to yield great benefit.
