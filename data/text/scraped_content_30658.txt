Title: How To Be Mindful At The Beach Content: Open up all of your senses: hearing, seeing, smelling, taste and touch.Rest on the sand and relax your body of any physical tension.Sit near the water. With your eyes closed, listen to the sound of the waves crashing on the shore.Take a walk with your feet in the water. Feel the various textures of the sand as the waves soak into it.Each time you inhale, smell the salty, fragrant air.Take time to contemplate the horizon and take in the vastness of the seascape.
