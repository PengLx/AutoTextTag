Title: Create a routine Content: Create a simple daily routine that includes time for both your personal and work priorities.Because oneof the most exhausting parts of balancing work and life is related to the multitude of tiny prioritization decisions (working in that project vs choosing to go out with a friend, for example).
Title: Find your peak hours Content: Determine when you do your best work. Focus your professional responsibilities during that time, and save your "off hours" for leisure.
Title: Embrace work friends Content: Build meaningful relationships with work friends, because they can relate to what you're dealing with.Your close circle will be eager to support you throughout your work's highs and lows, but talking about your work-related worries can leave you feeling isolated or even burdensome.
Title: Try something new Content: Finding a new creative outlet (whether it's learning a language or testing out your photography skills) can refresh your perspective on the balance between work and play.
Title: Make it personal Content: Define what balance means to you, and hold yourself to that.Choose to be honest with yourself about how you're holding up, and acknowledge that there's no universal formula for happiness.
