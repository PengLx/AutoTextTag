Title: Knowledge And Wisdom Content: Knowledge is the factual information, the awareness, and understanding of a subject. It is basically information about something that comes from learning facts.Wisdom is the ability to use knowledge and expertise to make sound judgement and decisions. It is an intangible quality that comes from experience and observation.
Title: The Time Factor Content: More time means that a person can attain more knowledge, but as knowledge is a passive acquisition of facts and data, having more knowledge does not mean having wisdom. Wisdom tends to be less affected by time, as it requires additional steps of applying judgement, drawing conclusions and adapting oneâ€™s behaviour accordingly.
Title: Application of Knowledge and Wisdom Content: Wisdom is related to knowledge, just as practice is related to theory. Wisdom is intrinsic whereas knowledge comes from external sources. Application of wisdom requires more than facts and data, like speculations, feelings, moral and ethical values. Applying knowledge is a much simpler and more linear process.Example: Development of nuclear weapons requires knowledge, but during wartime, using nuclear weapons on a country requires wisdom.
