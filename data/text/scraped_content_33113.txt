Title: The Lost Emotion Of Awe Content: Walking in nature has a newly found benefit of taking us deep into the mysteries of nature, trees, mountains and rivers, providing us with an emotion reserved for head-splitting spectacles: Awe. Awe takes us out of our ego state, increases connectedness, fostering prosocial behaviour.
Title:  Content: Modern society does not want us to be child-like, and in wonder. Every activity is sanitized and approved by others so that we donâ€™t look like a fool doing it. Awe-walks, where we look at nature as if we are looking at everything, the leaves, trees, flowers for the first time, helps us get in touch with this shunned and insulated emotion, which has plenty of therapeutic effects.
