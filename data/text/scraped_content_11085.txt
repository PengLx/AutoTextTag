Title: Defining a leader Content: It is difficult to define the quality of a leader. To say that a leader is someone who has followers is too simple. A captain may have soldiers who follow orders, but it makes a captain a commander, not a leader. To say that leadership is influence is too reduced. A robber with a gun has "influence" over his victim, but the source of influence is missing.It is easier to assert what leadership is not: Its not fancy titles, a position in hierarchy, or even management.
Title: Examining another definition Content: Bradberry and Kruse define leadership as a process of social influence which maximizes the efforts of others toward the achievement of a greater good. But even this definition is too narrow.Some leaders influence others not for the greater good: Adolf Hitler is an example of leading millions, but his leadership was wicked and barbaric. Following the wrong leader can lead to terrible consequences.Leadership “maximizes the efforts of others”:  Leadership alone cannot achieve this goal, for individual efforts depend on many factors. People may feel like they live in the shadow of leaders and may find their expectations unfair.However, leadership can work towards increasing the efforts of others.
Title: A new definition of leadership Content: Leadership is a process of social influence that works to increase the efforts of others in pursuit of a common goal.What most do agree with is that good leaders don't wait for a title. They simply lead, and others naturally follow them.
