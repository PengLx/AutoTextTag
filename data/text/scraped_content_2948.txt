Title: Get Rid of Your Stuff Content: Once in a while make sure you do a big purge: donate and recycle the stuff that no longer fits you or you don't use anymore.Don't get too sentimental.It's the only way to a tidier you.
Title: Don't Beat Yourself Up Content: This down-on-yourself attitude gets in the way of actually cleaning up.Even small changes can make a big difference. Accept that you'll never be perfectly neat. And that' s ok.
