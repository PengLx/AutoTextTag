Title: Hard Work Is Optional Content: Working hard does not mean you would be recognized or promoted. It is important to create a favourable impression, a perception that you are a hard worker. You have to manage the impression that you have made on others.
Title: Market Yourself Content: Make an effort to be noticed in the higher levels of the company. Show a little boldness in communicating your (perceived) accomplishments to those with the power strings.
Title: Fake Confidence Content: Leadership is about theatrics, to pretend to do something which is seemingly useful and to play a role. How we talk, appear, respond and behave in our daily interactions is what creates an image of ourselves in others minds.Showing that you are confident makes it seem as if you are powerful.
Title: Boss Flattery Content: Unfair as it is, having a great relationship with your boss is more important than your performance. If you manage to upset your boss or instill insecurity, then your performance cannot save you. You simply need to ask your boss what they want and then do that.According to a study, flattery works too well, even if it is overdone.
