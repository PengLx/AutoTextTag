Title: Metric Fixation Content: Metric Fixation, an epidemic in most of the world's biggest companies is a way to measure employee performance primarily by numbers, counted, tallied, compiled and analyzed in daily, weekly or monthly intervals.
Title: Incentivizing Leads to Gaming Content: The rewards of the metric performance measurement can be as a form of a monetary bonus, stocks or just an enhanced grade or designation, leading to competition among employees.This leads to many employees gaming the system to affect the bottom line of their metrics.Example: Surgeons can refuse to treat patients having a complicated condition, as it may affect their failure rate.
Title: Ignoring Real Values Content: Metric fixation can make employees ignore the real values and goals of the company and focus on their short-term weekly or monthly goals so that they keep their jobs, get a pay raise or have their stock options out at the right time.
Title: Millions of Hours Lost Content: On a macro level, metric fixation can lead to companies focussing on the quarterly report while ignoring any real R&D work, that takes years to provide any result.Companies also suffer millions of hours of productivity loss due to employees maintaining performance records, a lot of expenses spent on recording and tracking tools, and the time it takes to read or analyze the numbers.
