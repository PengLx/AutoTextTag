Title: Preferring The Front Right Burner Content: Most people prefer the front right burner on their stove.There are deep psychological reasons why many favor the front right side. Researchers claim that the four-burner stove problem is an outstanding issue in an ergonomic design that continues to attract academic attention.
Title: Natural Mapping and Memory Content: Natural mapping happens when the relationship between an object and its controls are clear. It reduces the need for memory and allows for more intuitive interactions.Most stoves are not naturally mapped. Typically the controls are arranged in a line while the burners are arranged in a rectangle. There are twenty-four possible arrangements. You have to use mental effort to understand which control goes with which burner.
Title: Poorly Mapped Stoves Content: In essence, we prefer the right burner because we've adapted to poorly mapped stoves.The most powerful burners are in the front, leaving the back ones for simmering. More people are right-handed. While there are many reasons for preferring the front controls, on a deeper level, it is because we don't want to go through the trouble every time to figure out which burner will be most appropriate.
Title: The Tradeoffs We Make Content: We can easily function without having a conscious knowledge of what we're doing.When people take the time to learn precise information, it can help save them in the long run. But because the long-term benefits are minimal, people will continue to use the front right burner.
Title: Designers Do the Precise Work for Us Content: There are numerous everyday objects in our lives that we unthinkingly rely on to keep our lives running smoothly. These objects had to be designed.Designers have to consider how users will think and how their muscle memory operates. They have to develop precise information to ensure that people can develop these convenient and reliable habits.
