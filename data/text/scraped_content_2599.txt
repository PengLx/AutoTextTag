Title: Reacting and Overreacting Content: Not all intense responses are overreactions.The problem arises when you start to react in a bigger way than justified.Overreactions never make the situation better.
Title: Types Of Overreactors Content: Internal: they overthink the things that don't go their way and are unable to put their focus onto something else.External: they yell, scream, or snap back at people when something isn't exactly how they want it.
Title: Know Your Triggers Content: This way, you can learn to be more in control of your reactions:Identify the things that bother you the most (rejection, criticism, or even something that has nothing to do with you).Think about basic contributing factors like lack of sleep, being hungry or thirsty, or being overworked.
Title: Pause Before Responding Content: Take a deep breath. It will slow down your fight or flight response and allows you to choose a more thoughtful and productive response.
Title: The FAA System Content: Freeze: Notice the changes within you (tension, temperature, heart rate). Keep breathing and cool down.Analyze: Think about what just happened rationally. Find a way to be compassionate and avoid personalizing what happened to you.Act: Express yourself with "I" statements or remove yourself from the situation. If you're still upset, find a way to rechannel how you feel.
Title: Gain Perspective Content: Separate yourself from the event to gain an outside perspective.Don't punish yourself for overreacting.Ask yourself:Why did I do that? What could I have done differently? Did it even matter? 
Title: Don't Bottle Up Your Emotions Content: Address the past if possible and resolve any emotional leftovers you might have: vent to a friend or keep a journal.Emotional baggage becomes more fuel when your bomb goes off.
