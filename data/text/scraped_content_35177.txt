Title: Let Me Interrupt You Content: Research shows that even the best listeners of the world, professional listeners like teachers, therapists, counsellors, coaches, listen only for about 11 seconds at a time.Humans expect and even crave for people who will not interrupt them, and listen to them attentively when they speak, no matter how long they speak. Humans long for undivided attention from the other person, but it is hard to find anyone who will not interrupt a person speaking, or will be a gentle, active and patient listener.
Title: Interruption Diminishes Us Content: Interruption is a destructive and violent act, and no matter what value the interrupter thinks that may be added by the very act of hedging one’s words in between, the speaker who is interrupted will never heal from the diminishing of his or her thoughts.Constant interruption creates polarization among individuals and even inside us, and not interrupting may be the very glue that can keep society together.
Title: Enter Smartphones Content: Interrupting humans were already doing a great job, but now the act is multifold, with the digital devices turning people into loud zombies who sometimes are impossible to talk to.As if to add salt to a wound, we have, for the past decade or so, the ultimate distraction and interruption device in our pockets, keeping us soaked in junk info, and making our minds relentlessly numb.
Title: Stop The Interruption Cycle Content: The root cause of Polarization is interruption, and this has to be cut down by a full determination to understand each other and promise to:Stop Interrupting others.Pay full attention to the other person.Stay interested in where the discussion will go next.Don’t make an excuse for interrupting, like providing clarity or correction.Don’t be a smart-Alec.If we are able to follow this, we can change the world.
