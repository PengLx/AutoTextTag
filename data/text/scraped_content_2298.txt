Title: Managing Letdowns Content: Every athlete is bound to face at least a few major letdowns in his or her career. When this happens, you want to let yourself feel down for a good 24 to 48 hours.But after two days have passed, it’s critical to shift from ruminating on the past to focusing on the future.Select the next goal and begin mapping out a process to get there.
Title: Dealing With Uncertainty Content: Prevent it: Do what you can to minimize uncertainty by training like you want to race.Manage it: Develop a mantra or automatic actions to fall back when uncertainty strikes.Grow from it: View uncertainty as an opportunity to grow. Welcome it on the path to personal growth.
Title: Turning Anxiety into Excitement Content: Pre-race nerves are common, even amongst professional athletes.Reframe nerves as excitement. When we do this, we harness heightened perception to raise ourselves up.Instead of telling yourself, “I’m anxious, I need to calm down,” tell yourself, “I am excited, my body is primed to perform.”
Title: Focusing on the Process Content: The best goal to have is simply to “get better.” Such an approach ensures that you never get too fixated on specific results.Quit thinking about success as finishing times, qualifying standards, or placements. Think about success as continual growth and progression over time.
