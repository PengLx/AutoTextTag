Personal Development,Love & Relationships
Title: Choices define us Content: Choices define us in all the fields, on all the levels. Whether it is about our personal or professional life, choices make us who we are. And sometimes these can differ from what the others choose. If our choices are too different from the ones of the people around, we might end up as lonely as possible, as individuals like feeling that they have something in common with each other.
Title: The 80/20 rule for building connections Content: Most people spend 80% of their time trying to get people to notice them by showing off how different they are and 20% trying to find something in common once they have some attention.What you should really be doing instead is spending 80% of your time finding common ground with people you want to get to know, and 20% of your time falling back on those unique things that set you apart.
Title: Be a valuable connection Content: In order to establish new connections, you should try to highlight what you have in common with others. However, while doing this, make sure you also integrate elements that set you apart: unique experiences that make you who you are today. After all, your new friends will like you for everything you represent, not only what they perceive as being familiar.
Title: Make meaningful connections Content: When making new friends, it is essential that both you and your new friends care about the friendship that is to be born.Therefore, focus firstly on the common passions and develop these before getting to any new adventure together with your new pals.
