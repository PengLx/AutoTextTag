Title: 'Crazy People' And Therapy Content: Many believe the only "crazy people need therapy" and end up waiting before they seek help, which only exacerbates the problem.In reality, people go to therapy for various reasons like coping with disorders, relationships, stress, grief, to figure out who they are or just to learn to live life to the fullest.
Title: Therapy And Reassurance Content: Most therapists are encouraging and emphatic, and some therapy models emphasize this warm support more than others. But not all therapy works this way, therapists also have to challenge and educate clients.
Title: Therapists And Money Content: There are many other areas of expertise that require less effort and are more financially rewarding than therapy. Therapists who thrive in this work deeply respect humanity and aren’t driven by money.
Title: Therapy As Common Sense Content: Some think all therapists do is rehash common sense. But, common sense is wisdom that applies to everyone, while therapy gives insights unique to you.Therapy gives you a place to focus only on yourself with the support of a trained expert who works to understand and guide you towards your goals.
Title: Friends As Therapists Content: Social support is important for everyone, especially when you’re super stressed. But therapy gives you access to highly trained professionals who’ve spent years learning and practicing to identify and treat issues of the mind and, unlike friends, will focus solely on you and, without judgment, keep your secrets.
Title: Therapy Seems Expensive Content: Therapy prices range from free in some community clinics to almost-lawyer hourly rates in the nation’s top private practices. Also, some psychotherapists offer their clients a sliding fee based on their income.People also should take into consideration what they stand to gain on their investment. Most people could save or earn more if they had their behavioral and emotional issues identified and addressed.
Title: Personal Experiences Content: The personal experience of therapists with an issue is one way to understand it but not the only one. Training, clinical experience and the personal experience of the same emotions or conflicts in a different context can help them have that understanding.Most therapists have the education, training and experience to understand and treat the problems clients bring to them, and if they don’t they refer them elsewhere.
Title: Therapy Goers Are Not Weak Content: Everyone needs help with some things and most people are not capable to deal with complex subjects on their own. Seeking help for your problems means you’re taking action. Asking for help often requires more strength than passively staying stuck.
Title: Fixing Their Own Problems Content: Whatever the initial reason for becoming a therapist, the ultimate goal is helping clients. If a therapist isn’t able to make their client’s healing their top priority, they probably won’t enjoy or succeed at being a therapist.
