Title: Start right away Content: We get so caught up in researching and thinking about a project that the anxiety to create something great can build up.Start immediately. You can even make small amounts of progress every day. Eventually you’ll get there.
Title: Focus Content: If you have a few projects at a time, focus on one. Work with intense focus. Do not allow distractions.When you feel your motivation slows down, switch to another project.
Title: Prioritize Content: If we are just ticking things off our to-do list without any order, the important tasks may not get completed.Determine the urgency of your tasks to figure out which requires priority.
Title: Set a buffer Content: Plans rarely go as smoothly as planned, so it’s always wise to set a buffer time in place.Break down the project into smaller tasks and before the deadline, schedule a day or two to give yourself a breather to review your project, to allow for delays or last-minute changes.
Title: Feedback Content: Don’t be afraid to seek progress feedback from your teammates, boss or even clients.It’s better to know beforehand you’re not on the right track, rather than finding out at the end that you’ve gotten it wrong.
