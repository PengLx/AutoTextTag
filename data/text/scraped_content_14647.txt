Title: It’s Okay To Wander Content: People’s minds wander, sometimes up to 30 to 40 percent of the time, while doing activities like reading.A wandering mind is invoking the good brain regions, which are associated with solving insight puzzles. It is at work trying to find the answer to your stress-related problems, automatically.
Title: A Wandering, Creative Mind Content: Mind-wandering makes your brain richer and more creative. Like a creativity machine left on its own, it helps to solve problems, enrich our understanding, and process information that is otherwise left unprocessed.
Title: Creativity Happens In Chaos Content: Creativity by default is a messy process. Doing creative stuff, and letting your mind wander forms new connections and helps us subconsciously compare and contrast our problems and solutions.Our brain's neural network needs to be fed different kinds of food, at the same time.
Title: The Dark Side Of Mind-Wandering Content: Mind-wandering has also been associated with unhappiness and stress. This happens when the individual’s current life situation is not optimal or desirable. The mind tries to make up for this by imagining other things.
Title: Focus-Unfocus Content: A wandering unfocused mind allows noise inside us, which helps in developing new ideas. A completely focused mind is shut, and as there is no noise which enters, it remains uncreative.Many people have certain rituals that allow them to relax their minds deliberately. Like pausing and savouring a hot cup of coffee in the morning, allowing the mind to go places.
