Title: Go from knowing to doing Content: Mastering something goes beyond the idea of knowing that something theoretically. As knowledge is incomplete without experience, so is conceptual understanding unsatisfactory without practice.Therefore, taking steps into a practical direction, doing something rather than just reading theoretical notions on the subject may imply you going to extreme lengths as exiting your comfort zone. However, this has always been the only successful way to obtain in the first place and then develop certain skills. 
Title: Control your behaviour Content: While controlling your thoughts and emotions has been long claimed to be extremely challenging, if not impossible, controlling your behaviour falls into a completely different category.Consequently, while forcing yourself at the very beginning into adopting a routine that involves practicing, doing, may turn out to be quite challenging, you will notice how in time, the routine itself will start building up your motivation to go on with the ‘doing’.
Title: Get practical Content: Take your thoughts to a more practical level. After having defined your goals, then done a little research on how to achieve them, make sure you start taking steps in order to turn them into reality. Get down to ‘doing the job’ and you will soon realize it took less than imagined.
