Without sleep, there is no restoration possible.Sleep studies prove it is worse than starvation, as early studies (19th century) conducted on puppies showed that they died in about five days if deprived of sleep and kept in motion.
Title: Reactive Oxygen Species Content: ... or ROS is a molecule that builds up in the intestines of animals that are denied sleep.Studies conducted on fruit flies and mice showed rising levels of ROS when kept in sleep deprivation.Antioxidants, when given to sleep-deprived flies, made them healthy and active again, proving that the artificial restoration is possible.
