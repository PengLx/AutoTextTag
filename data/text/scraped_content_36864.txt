Title: How to become world class in your pursuit? Content: 1. Great achievers in every field manage to get there only by intense practice. Great example is Michael Phelps who practiced swimming 6 hours daily for 6 years.2. Having realised this, still most people fail to follow consistent routines and practice. This is so because they are trying to avoid inconvenience and discomfort associated with practice.3. The key here is self-control. When the body, senses say, give up, when you feel pain, you have to endure that pain, that inconvenience, boredom and discomfort. You have to ignore everything else and just do what's needed to be done anyway. In fact and in essence, that what they call discipline.
