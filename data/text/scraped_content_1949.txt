Title: Musculature Fitness And Posture Content: Muscles with reduced flexibility limit your range of motion and over time it may lead to posture issues.The "core muscles" of the back, side, pelvis, and buttocks form a sturdy central link between your upper and lower body. Imbalances in one muscle affect the others.Weak core muscles encourage slumping, which tips your body forward and thus off balance, while strong lower leg muscles also help keep you steady when standing.
Title: Why Good Posture Matters Content: By standing up straight, you center your weight over your feet. This also helps you maintain correct form while exercising, which results in fewer injuries and greater gains.Poor posture isn't necessarily a bad habit, either. It may be the consequence of muscular issues.
