Title: Finding meaning above happiness Content: For many people, the pursuit of happiness is the meaning of life itself.However, Friedrich Nietzsche saw the pursuit of happiness as a pointless waste of human life. He was instead dedicated to the idea of finding meaning in life where people are willing to undertake great suffering in the name of a goal they have set.

Those who do small things suffer trivially.Herein lies the paradox of happiness. Activities directly focused to increase pleasure are unlikely to have a high payoff. Happiness is a side effect.
