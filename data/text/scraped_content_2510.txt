Title: You are the sum of your decisions Content: A few major decisions determine a good portion of how our lives, careers, and relationships turn out. The outcomes of these decision points will reverberate for years.Even small decisions can matter as they accumulate over the years.
Title: Why We Make Poor Decisions Content: We’re not as rational as we think.We’re not prepared. We don’t understand the invariant ideas — the mental models — of how the world really works.We don’t gather the information we need. We make decisions based on our “guts” in complex domains that require serious work to gather all the needed data.
Title: The World Is Multidisciplinary Content: We live in a society that demands specialization. Being the best means being an expert in something. A byproduct of this niche focus is that it narrows the ways we think we can apply our knowledge without being called a fraud. We shouldapply all the knowledge at our disposal to the problems and challenges we face every day.
