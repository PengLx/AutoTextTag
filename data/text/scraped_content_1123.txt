Title: The Value Of Management Content: Often seen as less important than leadership, management involves managing subordinates and linking between them and other agents, inside and outside the company.The managerial role is often mischaracterized as primarily involving detached planning and strategizing, but many effective strategies emerge as managers deal with small actions day to day. Moreover, the nature of managerial work is action oriented and full of interruptions.
Title: The Interdependency Between Leadership And Management Content: Leadership is often more valued than management, but leadership mostly decides and plans and it does so based on information brought by management. The system is dysfunctional if one of them is isolated.
