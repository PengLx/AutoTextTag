Title: The path to happiness is in perceiving mistakes as lessons rather than failures Content: It’s hard to feel peaceful if you punish yourself for making mistakes. You may even end up avoiding risks and new experiences to escape the pain of your own self-judgment. But trying new things not only opens up avenues for you, but also brings a sense of fulfillment in life.
Title:  Content: Emotions don’t go away when we hide them. If anything, they control us even more; we just don’t realize it.
Title: Avoiding negative emotions can give you the feeling of being trapped in a prison Content: When you can’t accept them, you can’t deal with them. You deny yourself the opportunity to resolve those feelings permanently and feel free.
Title: Life always happens in the present Content: Holding on to your past will only allow it to control your present.Thinking about the future, on the other hand, will lead you to daydream and imagine potential outcomes, which may be far worse than the reality.
