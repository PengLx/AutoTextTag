Title: Plan the Rest of Your Day Content: When you don't feel like working on your tasks, take a few moments to plan your day.Even if you do it as a form of procrastination, to postpone doing the actual work, it will help you by keeping you on track for the rest of the day.
Title: Smaller Manageable Parts Content: Break the project you don't want to start into smaller pieces.Breaking it down into small tasks and adding those to your to-do list isn't exactly fun, but it is less overwhelming than working. And it's also useful: When you finally do get around to starting, you've got a strategy.
Title: Clean Something Content: Clean something every time you don't want to get started on a work project. Don't listen to a podcast or turn on the radio. Just clean. Make it as boring as possible, so that your mind wanders.This does two things: it delays actually working on your project and it gives you time to think, possibly generating ideas that will come in handy whenever you get back to the project you're trying to put off.
Title: Tackle the Simplest Tasks Content: Every job involves at least a few simple tasks that don't require your full attention, and these make for great productive procrastination.The best tasks for this have a few things in common: They need to get done, they don't require a lot of focus, and they're different enough from your main project that they feel like a break.
Title: Take a Walk or Exercise Content: Any kind of exercise works.Use the time that you're stuck to get up and do something physical for a bit. It's good for you, and research shows that regular physical activity can also help with your cognition.
Title: Talk to Your Co-Workers Content: Reach out to your co-workers when you're stuck.Catch up with your co-workers. See what they're working on. You'll learn something, feel better connected with the people around you, and maybe even find a little bit of inspiration.
