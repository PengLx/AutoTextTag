Title: Quit something Content: Let go of activities that no longer make sense.Quit a recurring meeting. Quit a committee. Quit Social media. Quit a program. By doing this,you automatically open up space.
Title: Limit something Content: When you can't let go completely of an activity, youcan open up more space in your life by setting firmer boundaries around it so that you still have space for other items that matter.For example, limit the number of hours you spend on checking and responding to emails or the time you spend on your phone.
Title: Pause something Content: Giveyourself permission to take a break.For example, choosing to eat lunch away from your computer can give you a sense of peace and space, even if you’re away from your desk for only 10 minutes.
Title: Delegate something Content: Delegate activities that you don’t need to do yourself.You can save yourself at least four to five hours a week by having others help.As you plan your day, ask yourself: Is this something that I really need to do myself, or could someone else do this instead?
Title: Add something Content: If you want more time to do something you “never have time for,” start putting that activity first and then arrange your schedule around it.Add an exercise class, book a trip, plan a get-together with friends—and don’t cancel it.
