Title: Lack of practical skills Content: Our modern job descriptions largely rely on our minds rather than our physical skills in order to get work done.Having some basic practical skills to complement your “soft” skills will certainly come in handy in survival scenarios, particularly when it comes to rebuilding from catastrophe. And you can develop them by simply trying things out.
Title: Practice self-reliance in advance Content: Not only will having DIY skills help you rebuild your community, they also greatly increase your self-reliance.This means being able to take care of yourself and survive with little and work with what you have. But don't wait until you need to be self-reliant to cultivate these skills.
Title: Basic physical fitness Content: Whether you’re lost in the woods from an afternoon hike or in the midst of the zombie apocalypse, the simple act of walking may make the difference between life and death.
Title: The importance of relationships Content: You may be self-reliant and physically fit, but you can almost guarantee there will come a time when you’ll need the help of another person.Get to know the people around, no matter their level in your business or personal hierarchy.
Title: About technology Content: Being dependent on new technologies can have a negative impact on our survival efforts.The more forms of technology you’re familiar with using (anything from hammers to modern complex electronics boards) the more problems you’ll be able to solve, the more useful you’ll be to others, and the greater the chances of your survival.
