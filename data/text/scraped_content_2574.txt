Title: Health and happiness Content: They are the foundation of living a remarkable life.There's something about physical movement that centers the mind.If you're struggling with something mentally, then get out and move physically.
Title: Live in the arena  Content: ... instead of judging from the crowd. If you play the game, you'll produce average work, you'll make stupid decisions, you'll get beat by someone who is faster, or better.It's better to work on things that are important to you and feel the frustration of failure than to play it safe and never push yourself.
Title: Move toward the next thing Content: ... not away from the last thing.If something isn't going well, then don't run from it. Find something else to get excited about instead. Spend as much time as you can doing things that pull you in rather than pushing frustration away.
