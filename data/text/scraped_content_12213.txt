Title: About uncertainty Content: Most of us are quite addicted to a degree of certainty of all kinds, as this is what makes us feel safe. And now we all know nothing compares to feelings such as safety and control. When faced with uncertainty, on the other hand, we tend to make irrational decisions, due to sheer fear.
Title: Stepping in the unknown Content: While it can be quite scary, stepping out in the unknown is necessary every now and then. In order to push your limits, you should consider taking up new challenges that will not only make you experience fear, but most probably also later success into dealing with new and stressful situations. Furthermore, your brain will get trained to form new connections, which can only prove beneficial in the long run.
Title: Train your mind to defeat uncertainty Content: Recent research has shown that uncertainty scares people even more than knowing that things are going to actually end up badly. Therefore, in order to be mentally prepared to beat uncertainty, what better way than just imagining the worst case scenario? If it turns out badly, you will at least not be taken by surprise and, if it turns out well, you will be happy.
Title: 'Name it to tame it' Content: Fear can be harmful to us in more than too many ways. When feeling stressed because of an uncertain situation, try verbalizing your emotions.You will feel a smaller burden afterwards and, surprisingly enough, you will be able to make better decision on how to handle these emotions.
