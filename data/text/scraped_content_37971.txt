Title: Efficient Sleepers Content: Many successful people have said on record that they donâ€™t sleep much, and yet remain energetic and productive.A new scientific discovery shows that some people have a gene mutation (in a gene named DEC2)that results in less sleep requirement.These efficient sleepers may need just four hours of sleep and make up about 1 percent of the total population.
