Title: The ultimate savior Content: We tend to see romantic love as the ultimate savor that will overwhelm us with such passion and devotion, that it will take away all of our problems.When we take care of our partner, we don't pay much attention to ourselves and our needs. We tend to avoid our issues and stop investing in the painful practice of self-discovery.
Title: The danger of escapism Content: We may help our partner figure out their issues but neglect our own. We find refuge in our partners, and sometimes a refuge where we can escape from ourselves. That is dangerous and unhealthy in the long run.
Title: Real love Content: If we want to live in a society where we take our emotional health seriously, where self-care, self-awareness, and self-love are valued, we will teach each other more about different perspectives of love.With real love, we will accept and value ourselves without relying entirely on someone else for validation.
