Title: Work: An inevitable Curse Content: Working, in broad terms has always been a curse, especially in ancient times for a majority of people. Work is to be done for providing basic food and shelter, and in most cases, it does not provide any stimulation or reward.In the 18th century, most of the working populations used to work on pipe-organ making, lathe and turning, baking, sugar refining, paper-making and bookbinding, soapmaking, mining and pottery, among other kinds of mostly unpleasant work.
Title: The Purpose Of Work Content: Work is the effort we make to get what nature did not provide us automatically, or what is not in abundance. We need food, water, shelter, clothes, and basic necessities that make our lives easier. We invent tools to help ourselves where nature didn’t help us.Example: We couldn’t carry too much water in our cupped hands, so we worked and made a bucket to carry it.
Title: The Tools We Use To Work Content: Apart from simple mechanical objects that define what tools are, like a hammer or a bucket, tools can also have broader meanings like:A book is a tool to preserve our ideas and memory.A painting can be a tool to preserve the beauty of what we see or imagine.Religion can be a tool to drill into our minds the ideas of morality and consolation that we otherwise will not want to think about.
Title: Working With A Tool Content: As we started using tools, we realized that work, when it feels less arduous or even pleasurable, can be stimulating, rewarding and something we would love to do.Normal work makes us put aside our creativity, sensitivity, and other qualities to be productive, but a tool, if it is a delight to use, can become our insight into happiness.
Title: What We Love To Do Content: It’s not easy for most to find out what they love and to do that for the rest of their lives. Our education system is not of much help to us in terms of how our life should be.If we are somehow able to find what we love to do, what pays well, and what we are good at doing, we can find meaning in work, live a fulfilling life and not toil like our ancestors.
