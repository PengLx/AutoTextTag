Title: What Confidence Is Content: True confidence is a feeling of self-assurance that is grounded in an authentic experience of our own ability, perspective and sufficiency.It’s a stable connection to the fact that we can do what we want to do, feel how we want to feel, and be who we want to be in this world.
Title: Why Confidence Matters Content: Confidence is an amplifier of quality and success.Confidence is essential to influence and leadership.Confidence isn’t just about style. It’s also about substance.Confidence protects us. It'sone of the greatest weapons we can develop.
Title: Nonverbal communication Content: Confidence is expressed most profoundly through our bodies. No matter how well we speak, the way we feel about ourselves will always manifest in our posture, our hand movements and our facial features.So commit to strong, positive body language and make a conscious effort to form habits that make your nonverbal communication automatic.
Title: Vocal tonality Content: Vocal tonality (the physical quality of our voice, our pitch, articulation, syntax, volume and intention) expresses and reinforces our sense of self.Speak in statements, not questions, articulate and enunciate, and avoid the use of filler words.
Title: Authentic vulnerability Content: Authenticity transforms normal insecurity into grounded confidence.While faked confidence hides insecurity, weakness and self-doubt, true authenticity owns and acknowledges these less pleasant experiences in a way that ultimately enhances our sense of self.
Title: A process-oriented mindset Content: Process-oriented confidence is the opposite of the “fake it till you make it” philosophy.While the “fake it till you make it” approach suggests we should pretend our way toward true confidence, the process-oriented approach suggests we should become our way toward true confidence.
