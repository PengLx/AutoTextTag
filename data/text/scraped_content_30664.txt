Title: Honesty As A Blind Spot Content: Since man started observing human behaviour, our focus has been on the studies done on deception, morality, and lying. In the last fifty years, almost no study or research has been carried out on honesty in the philosophical domain.This is glaring neglect as honesty tops the list of the most important virtues, alongside courage, patience, humility and kindness.
Title: Lying Is Becoming Mainstream Content: As lies morph into a common, accepted standard, our attention (and obsession) is with guilt, fakeness, deceit and manipulation.Human beings, according to countless behavioural studies, lie when they know they can get away with it, or when they see other people lie, and even when we are in groups, where we tend to mimic the others(herd mentality).
Title: Dishonesty As a Global Currency Content: In any social setting, lies keep the world from falling apart, becoming the real global currency:Organizations and their employees routinely lie to preserve identity, protect the reputation of an individual or groupIn relationships, one lies to spare the other from feeling bad, or to avoid an awkward situation.We lie to ourselves and consistently believe we are smarter or better looking that we really are.We lie on social media.
