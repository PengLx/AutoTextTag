Title: Productivity Or Procrastination Content: We try to make a list of stuff we have to do in the morning only to feel pressurized or paralyzed. The to-do list isn’t our enemy, but we become ambitious and put a lot more than possible in it. Big goals can be daunting and counterproductive.
Title: Do Just One Thing Content: Doing just one thing in a day alleviates the pressure that comes with trying to accomplish too much, which makes us procrastinate the whole day, doing nothing at all. One feels a sense of accomplishment and success. The one thing needn’t be too broad or too narrow, but can be stuff like:Clean the room.Declutter the cabinet.Wash the car.Give away useless stuff.
