Title: Sharpen Your Axe Content: Everybody, everywhere seems to be busy. Most people are just too busy doing and trying to achieve that they do not take the necessary time to renew themselves, tolearn and grow—to sharpen the “axe”.We overwork ourselves amidst the overwhelming tasks at hand. We feel drained, exhausted and our productivity declines. Do we simply take a break, rest and relax? That isn’t sharpening the axe—that’s just putting the axe down. The blade will still be dull after your break. Yes, the woodcutter needs to rest, but it’s only when he sharpens his blade, learns new techniques, trains up his strength and stamina, that he becomes more productive.Dr. Stephen R Covey defined “Sharpen Your Saw (or Axe)” to be: increasing your personal productivity, by having a balanced strategy to renew yourself in the four aspects of life: Physical, Social, Mental, and Spiritual.Physical: Eating well, sleeping well and exercising well.Social/Emotional: Having a good social life. Building meaningful connections with others.Mental:Learning something new, reading (books are your mentors), and writing.Spiritual: Expanding spiritual self through meditation, spending time relaxing in nature.
