Title: Avoiding Burnout Content: Just doing enough every day, even if it is not the whole list, is the key to avoiding burnout. Being 100 percent productive does not mean working 18 hours a day without a break.Not working, relaxing, or calling it quits is part of the process of work, after we figure out what is ‘enough’ for us.
Title: The Minimum Output Level Content: We need to find a key measurement figure of the minimum output we need to churn out in a particular time, like daily, weekly or monthly, and stick to that.We need to set realistic goals that give us control (and not drive us crazy) while breaking it down to daily action items that are doable without much thought.We also need to enjoy the day, working on multiple projects and stress-free activities that provide rest and energy.
Title: Burnout Avoidance By Saying NO Content: The needs we have, like building a new house, or working out every day, growing our business, or getting a promotion is endless and always there in front of us.The key is to have a happy life, and we need to focus on what we want to get out of life, which at its core isn’t that much.The way to find a holistic middle path and avoid burnout is to do less and optimize your life to be fulfilling and meaningful.
