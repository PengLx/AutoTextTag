Title: Inspiration vs Principles Content: If you feel lost, or as though you don’t know where you want your life to go next, you don’t need more inspiration.You need principles. Without them, your life is not going to get better just because you envision and then try to create a new one. Those problems are only going to follow you, and get bigger as your life does.
Title: What a principle is Content: It's a fundamental truth that you can use to build the foundation of your life. A principle is not an opinion or a belief. A principle is a matter of cause and effect.Principles can become personal guidelines. And the point of having principles is that it shifts you from short-term survival to long-term thriving.
Title: Why inspiration is ineffective Content: Inspiration can be misleading. Big dreams not backed by strategized plans are big flops waiting to happen.Inspiration means you take a feeling and elaborate on it. You allow your mind to wander, you piece together pretty pictures and create an image of how you’d like your life to feel.
Title: Developing your own principles Content: Begin with this:What do you value?What do you want to experience in your life?What makes you uneasy or gives you anxiety?For example: You valuefinancial freedom, and so by principle, you are going to put your extra cash toward repaying debt or building savings or investments.
Title: Having clear principles Content: A good life is built from the inside out and is based on a foundation of self-conduct and prioritization. It’s not as dreamy as a vision board, but it’s a lot more effective.When you are clear on what your principles are, youcan start working toward goals that support what you do and do not want to experience.
