Title: Getting into running Content: You don't necessarily have to be the running type. Almost anyone can be a runner.And with running, you don't need a membership, expensive equipment, or a qualified coach. You do need a good pair of running shoes to take care of your feet and knees. Other than that, wear what you feel good in.
Title: When you first start, run slowly Content: Run slow enough that you're pretty sure you could overtake yourself at a brisk walk.The point of running is endurance, and to manage that, you have to keep your heart rate elevated for the entire period of every training run. That means erring on the side of caution and only speeding up when you hardly break a sweat 20 minutes in.
Title: Get with the running program Content: Slowly build up stamina over the first few weeks and months. To start, run three times a week for eight weeks, beginning with sessions that involve more walking than actual running, and ending with 30 minutes of non-stop jogging.Your first session, run for a minute, then walk for 90 seconds and repeat the pattern eight times.Four weeks later, running has increased to three sets of five minutes, with three minutes of walking in between.At the end of week five, the training wheels come off, and you run for a full 20 minutes non-stop.
Title: Considerations about running Content: Don't worry about how you look. No one cares how sweaty you are or how slow or fast you're going.Don't compare yourself with others (unless it helps). Many services will track your stats or let you join a global community of runners. Before you join them, remember why you're running and consider if it may not demotivate you instead.
