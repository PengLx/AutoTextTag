Title: Why it takes time for our muscles to strengthen Content: Strength training is more physiologically intricate than initially realised. When we start to lift weights, our muscles are not the first to strengthen and change. However, our nervous systems do.When we lift weights, we might feel some initial disappointment when our muscles do not quickly take shape. But weight training soon causes us to generate more muscular force where we can push, pull, and raise more weight than before, even though our muscles still look the same.
Title: The cellular effects of resistance training Content: Scientists have known for some time that early increases in strength involve changes in the connections between the brain and muscles.Particular bundles of neurons and nerve fibers carry commands from the brain's motor cortex to the spinal cord to the muscles. When the neural input to your muscles increases, the commands become more forceful, and the muscles should respond similarly. When strength training, the initial gains are about strengthening the reticulospinal tract. Only later do the muscles start to grow.
