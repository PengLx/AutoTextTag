Title: Parents should apologize, here's why Content: Apologizing to your child when you are wrong isnâ€™t easy, but it is necessary if you want a good relationship.Sadly, many parents never say sorry because they feel they are more superior to their children. Furthermore, they think they would lose authority if they admitted wrong. In fact, some think they would lose respect. That it somehow goes against the natural order of things.This is faulty thinking. Apologizing to your child is a sign of respect for the overall relationship you have with him. Your child will not be young forever. When he becomes an adult, you will want the relationship to naturally change into an equal friendship. If there have been gross offenses along the way, the transition to an adult relationship will be forced, strained, or even possibly broken.
