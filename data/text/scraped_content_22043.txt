Title: Counterfactual Thinking Content: Thinking in a counterfactual way is a non-mainstream mode of thinking about the alternatives of a present situation or turn of events.It means imagining possible alternatives to events that have already happened; something that is contrary to what really occurred.
Title: Benefits of Counterfactual Thinking Content: Counterfactual thinking makes us look at the events from multiple angles, making us mentally experience it from a different spectrum.Thinking with a counterfactual bend of mind boosts creativity in solving future challenges.It helps the thinker store important information that could impact the analysis and solutions of future events.A non-linear, non-mainstream way of thinking avoids the usual pitfalls of anger, anxiety, fear and grief when things go wrong. This sort of action-oriented approach comes with a positive bend of mind and a desire to do something, instead of getting stuck in an endless loop of worry and anxiety.
