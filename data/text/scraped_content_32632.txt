Title: Insight doesn't arrive in quantity Content: The repeat-intake of opinioneering stifles original thought even as you believe you are receiving more and more insight. (Hint: insight doesn’t arrive in quantity.) In actuality, bingeing on opinion-affirming media is an emotional and physical fix more than an intellectual one, even though the tools are words, facts, and arguments. It is ersatz learning, no more nutritious to your intellect than consuming a bag of chips is to your body — and probably with equivalent health costs over time.
Title: Reject "comfort media" Content: Set a goal to pull the plug on habitually reading opinion-adjacent news or political media.
Title: Don't read the same arguments multiple times Content: How do you know when you’re imbibing comfort media? Repetition. It’s when the argument is one you’ve read before and are reading again to restore a sense of validation.
Title: Challenge your mind Content: Actors and opera singers often do their worst work in the presence of absurdly friendly crowds, and their best in the presence of crowds which sit silent and unmoved.
