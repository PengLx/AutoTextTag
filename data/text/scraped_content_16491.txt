Title: Constraints For Creativity Content: Limitations, constraints and deadlines, paradoxically help us unlock our latent creativity. They help us try the untested, take the risk and explore stuff we normally would not.Constraints act as rules and guidelines that work for you in a positive way, whether you understand them or not.
Title: Freedom From Paralysis Content: While too many constraints and rules are counterproductive, a balanced level of constraints helps creativity. Clearly stated constraints help us plan our scope of work and the amount of effort that has to be put.Example: A pre-existing constraint with an employer of providing a two-page CV along with the cover letter help us draft the same with the limitations in mind.
Title: For All Budding Writers Content: Applying constraints is like stoking the fires of creativity for writers:Embrace some arbitrary rules, and add some more if that doesnâ€™t work. Remove some rules if it feels limiting.Get some inspiration from other writings, avoiding any real or perceived plagiarism. Even if it is a copy, it will provide you with a kickstart, and can be removed later.Make up some crazy constraints and go into unchartered territoryStay calm and let creativity find its way.
