Title: Motion Dynamics Of Life Content: According to Newtonâ€™s first law, objects tend to remain at rest unless an external force or energy makes them change their state.Applied to life, this would mean everything requires energy and effort to get started, and be propelled towards action.
Title: Initial Push Content: The energy, force or effort in the initial stage would be far more than what is required for the object to keep moving. If our project, like starting a new business, was like launching a rocket, we would like to start it with the initial super thrust, but we also need to keep the momentum going.The entire journey requires some amount of energy to keep moving forward. It also moves in one direction only, and changing its direction needs a considerable amount of effort and force.
Title: Building And Maintaining Momentum Content: It is easier to keep any moving object in motion, than to put in motion an object at rest, due to inertia. Inversely it is harder to stop a moving object. Applied in life, it means if we are moving and keep getting momentum, it is hard to stop us from reaching our goals.The trick is to have patience and keep going until you reach a point that your own force propels you forward, making it harder for anyone to stop you.
