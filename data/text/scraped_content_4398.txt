Title: The Spiral of Productivity Shame Content: Productivity shame is a feeling that you are not doing enough, whatever the number of hours you are working, or the number of tasks you are crossing off your to-do list. It also means you feel guilty when you rest or take time off watching a movie or just play around for a while. All of this is harmful and can lead to stress and burnout.Productivity shame creates a cycle of failure and is a terrible and negative approach towards getting others to work.
