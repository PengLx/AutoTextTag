Title: Mimetic Traps Content: Whatever we’re doing, it’s worth asking ourselves 'what game are we trying to play here?’ and 'what are the victory conditions of this game?’ And our answers to this will change over time, so it’s always worthreconsidering victory conditionsFrequently stop to think 'why does this matter?’ or 'what’s the point of this thing I’m doing?’It’s way too easy to get sucked into the trap of competing with our peers for whatever proxy-for-social-status our particular field values.Instead try to take a more zoomed-out, peronsal-preference-based approach. Who do I want to be? What do I want my life to look like? And who do I want to serve?﻿Hopefully that’ll lead to a more authentic and fulfilling way of approaching life / career / everything.
