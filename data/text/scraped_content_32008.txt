Title: What superstition is Content: Superstition can be described as the belief in supernatural forces, such as fate, to describe unpredictable factors. Psychologists found that superstition comes from the assumption that a connection exists between non-related events that coincide.Individual beliefs and experiences drive superstitions, explaining why they are generally irrational.
Title: Positive and negative superstitions Content: Some superstitious beliefs help promote a positive mental attitude, although they can lead to irrational decisions, such as trusting in good luck and destiny rather than sound decision making. Carrying charms, wearing certain clothes, preferring specific colours, and using particular numbers are elements of superstition.Superstitions can also give rise to the idea that objects and places are cursed. Many buildings do not have a 13th floor. In some countries, such as Italy and Brazil, the typical unlucky number is 17.
Title: Sporting superstitions Content: Superstition is also prevalent within sport. It has been shown to reduce tension and provide a sense of control over unpredictable factors. Personalized actions and behaviors include wearing lucky clothes, kit, and charms.
Title: When superstition becomes a failure to perform Content: While superstitions can provide reassurance and help reduce anxiety in some people, research has shown that it can also become self-reinforcing, meaning the behavior develops into a habit, and failure to perform the ritual can result in anxiety.This is regardless of the actual outcome of a situation that is still dependent on known factors and not unknown supernatural forces.
