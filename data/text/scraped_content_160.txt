Title: A lot of people that are searching for happiness will end up with “shiny object syndrome" Content: People bounce from goal to goal because they’re looking for something (or someone) to take away all their suffering.Knowing yourself and what you truly want can help you develop purpose and focus, so that you don’t even have time to waste pondering happiness.
Title: We all need to learn to separate our happiness from our achievements Content: It’s okay to feel content with our lives simply because we have an inherent sense of self-worth.Reaching our goals can obviously bolster this feeling and give us a deep sense of accomplishment, but the absence of achievement should not mean the absence of happiness.
