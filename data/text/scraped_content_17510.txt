Two prisoners in separate interrogation rooms have two options: to confess or to lie, and this can lead to three outcomes:If both confess, they both serve eight years in prison.If both lie, then they both serve one year in prison.If one of them confesses and one of them lies, then the liar gets maximum prison and the confessor goes free.This thought experiment tells us that when we make decisions, the ones which are taken by others also factors in.
Title: The Millennials Dilemma Content: The Prisoners Dilemma can be reimagined as a life-optimization matrix.

Title: The Domino Effect Content: Our past luxuries just end up being necessities in a blink of an eye, once people get used to them. This also creates new obligations and the domino effect of a further set of expenses and tasks, leading to new kinds of services and optimizations.
Title: Everyoneâ€™s Depressed Content: New kinds of exotic mental illnesses, which almost everyone has, make burnout and the falling health conditions normal to millennials. The never-ending rat race is a rigged game, with the Millennials Dilemma being played out indefinitely, leading to co-operation. We keep on playing the rigged game, optimizing and working even more.
