Title: The Paleo Diet Content: The Paleo Diet is an effort to go back to eating how we’re biologically designed to eat, allowing us to tap into our genetic potential and start living healthier immediately.
Title: Lose weight on the Paleo Diet Content: Eat fewer calories than you burn every day.Eat mostly real food if you want to be healthy.Do those two things consistently for a decade to KEEP the weight off.When you only eat real food and avoid all unhealthy food, you’re more likely than not going to run a caloric deficit – and thus lose weight.
Title: Eat the following: Content: Meat – GRASS-FED, not grain-fed.Fowl – Chicken, duck, hen, turkey.Fish – Wild fish, as mercury and other toxins can be an issue in farmed fishEggs – Omega-3 enriched cage free eggs.Vegetables – As long as they’re not deep-fried, eat as many as you want.Oils – Olive oil, coconut oil, avocado oil – think natural.Fruits – Fruits have natural sugar, and can be higher in calories, so limit if you’re trying to lose weight.Nuts – High in calories, so they’re good for a snack only.Tubers – Sweet potatoes and yams. Higher in calories and carbs.
Title: Avoid the following: Content: Grains which are calorically dense, nutrient deficient, and contain gluten and lectins.Many are gluten intolerant. Lectins are natural toxins and prevent the gastrointestinal tract from repairing itself.Sugars.Processed foods.Dairy for the Paleo purists, although it can be consumed.
Title: Carbs aren’t evil Content: Carbs tend to be calorically dense (lots of calories) without being satiating (meaning you tend to eat way more than you intended).Try to get carbs from vegetables, sweet potatoes, and fruit.Fewer carbs = less glucose in your system, which means your body can start burning fat as your fuel source.
Title: How much to eat Content: From Nutrients:Always start with a good protein source with each meal (eggs, steak, chicken, fish, pork) along with some vegetables.Add salt if you're feeling tired all the time.From Fats:Add healthy fats to the equation: avocado, almonds, walnuts, almond butter, olive oil, etc.Eat when you’re hungry, don’t eat when you’re not.
Title: Criticisms of the Paleo Diet  Content: “This type of diet can get expensive.”It is if you compare the cost of a paleo meal with ramen noodles or bread which contains loads of carbs and empty calories.“It’s difficult to eat Paleo in today’s society!”It requires careful planning and willpower but can be done.“But this is just a meat diet, and eating all meat is bad!”The biggest component of the diet is vegetables, not meat.“The Paleo Diet is too restrictive and I can’t live like this.”The goal is to rethink your relationship with food and develop a strategy that you can live with permanently.
