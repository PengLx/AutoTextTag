Title: Breathing: The First Act Of Life Content: Breathing is the first basic act of life and we take about 670 million breaths in a lifetime.Breathing is so natural to us that very few scientists have studied it in detail. Breathing is thought of as just a binary activity crucial to our lives, but the way we breathe matters a lot.
Title: How To Breathe Right Content: A perfect ‘slow’ breath that creates profound effects in our body and mind is this: 5.5 seconds inhaling, followed by 5.5 seconds of exhaling. This can be practiced for a few minutes, or even an hour.The heart, lungs and other organs benefit greatly, and the imbalances are restored to an extent.
