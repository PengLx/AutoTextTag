Angry cry of the Upholder: "Why can't people just get their tasks done?"
Title: Questioner anger Content: Questioners need reasons and justifications, and they're angry when other people act, or expect them to act, for reasons that are unexplained or arbitrary. They're frustrated when others won't give them the answers they expect, or won't give them time to research.Angry cry of the Questioner: "Why do people just follow along like lemmings, and expect me to do the same for no good reason?"

Their anger is often tinged with resentment and indignation, a feeling of being exploited or neglected or treated unfairly. Of the 4 Tendencies, the Obliger Tendency is the biggest (for both men and women). Angry cry of the Obliger: "Why am I the only one doing anything around here? Why am I meeting other people's expectations, but not meeting my expectations for myself?"
