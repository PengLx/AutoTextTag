Title: Don't just take notes. Read them Content: If you have a bunch of pads or notebooks filled with meeting notes that you never consult, your note-taking isn't providing the most value over time.Re-reading notes does make a difference. Because the chief value of note-taking isstoring information so it could be consulted later. 
Title: Digital vs. handwritten note-taking Content: There's little research into the benefits of digital note-taking over handwritten notes.But the findings underlinethat typing out notes improves later recall, while copy and pasting text into notes is actually detrimental to learning because it encourages wordiness.
Title: Structure and hierarchy Content: The 
most rigorously structured notes, those with hierarchal ordering and numbered 
subsections, are of the highest quality and accuracy.But although these notes are significantly more precise than freestyle note-taking, there is little difference in the ability of the note-taker to recall the material.
Title: Mind-mapping Content: It brings visual structure to notes, usually involving writing one word in 
the center and drawing offshoots from it with related ideas and phrases.Mind-mapping is significantly more effective than just writing out notes and helps with presenting the information back with more clarity and coherence than traditional notes.
Title: The Von Restorff effect in notes taking Content: We remember things that stand out.Underlining
 something makes it stand out against other words and that makes 
recalling that word easier.
