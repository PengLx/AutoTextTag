Title: Self-understanding Content: To make a marriage work, you have to be the right person.Rather than looking for the right partner, become aware of your blind spots, growing edges and vulnerabilities. Take responsibility and learn how to work with them effectively. Then invite in a compatible, suitable partner.
Title: You can’t avoid marital conflict Content: Blaming, oversimplifying, and seeing oneself as a victim are all common traits of unhappy couples and failed marriages.Conflicts should be approached by looking together at the problem.
Title: A good marriage takes skill   Content: Most of us don’t have adequate communication skills going into marriage. It is important to build this skill.
Title: You need a similar worldview Content: Even the best communication skills won’t help a couple that sees the world completely different.The more aligned you are on certain crucial dimensions—such as day-to-day compatibility, or whether you are on the same wavelength about larger issues—the better off you’ll be as a couple.
