Title: Intuition as a tool Content: Emotions and intuition are not fallible tools that always need to be ignored or even corrected by rational faculties,.Intuition is the result of a lot of processing that happens in the brain but has not yet reached your conscious awareness.
Title: Predictive processing framework Content: Research suggests that the brain is a large predictive machine, constantly comparing incoming sensory information and current experiences against stored knowledge and memories of previous experiences, and predicting what will come next. This is described in what scientists call the “predictive processing framework”.This ensures that the brain is always as prepared to deal with the current situation as optimally as possible.
Title: The two thinking styles Content: Intuitive thinking is described as automatic, fast, and subconscious. Analytic thinking, on the other hand, is slow, logical, conscious and deliberate. Analytic and intuitive thinking are not opposites. They are complementary and can work in concert.Even groundbreaking scientific research may start with intuitive knowledge that enables scientists to formulate innovative ideas and hypotheses, which later can be validated through rigorous testing and analysis.
Title: Intuition and biases Content: Because intuition relies on automatic and fast processing, it also falls prey to misguidances, such as cognitive biases. Despite this, familiarizing yourself with common cognitive biases can help you spot them in future occasions.For every situation that involves a decision based on your assessment, consider whether your intuition has correctly assessed the situation.
