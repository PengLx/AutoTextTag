Title: System One and System Two Content: Our brains have two "systems" that complement eachother, with their own capabilities, limitations and functions.System One is fast, automated and precise, but can be easily tricked and has a small working window.System Two is slower, can make complex thoughts achieved in a specific algorithm and takes control over it's brother when he needs to with it's long but limited attention buffer.
Title: System One Content: With it's lighting fast reactions, System One is present in almost every common situation. It's actions are sometimes unstoppable and can be trained to steal tasks from the second System.Depending on the complexity, here are some tasks that System One makes:Solves simple math like 2+2Recognizes a good chess move (if you are a chess expert)Reads words on big adsDrives the car on a empty roadMakes you look in the direction of a sound
Title: System Two Content: Being slower but very powerful, this part of the brain can partialy suppes the other one while taking control on our body and forming logical and complex operations that need an attention span while being easily interrupted, like:Solves complex math like 412* 525Searching for a personControlling your behaviourCompleting a formularParking a car
Title: Attention and Effort Content: Our brain have a very limited attenion buffer. Our System Two can't give more than he has. We need to prioritize it's tasks to make it work efficiently.We will use the minimal effort law, thinking as little as possible, unless we act on it with all our thinking energyIf we let our intuition take control, we may give a wrong response, making us repeat the process with a deeper search in our memory, this time calling for the Second System
Title: Priming the brain Content: Our mind can easily and unknowingly fall in a priming situation where certain things prepare ourself to take a certain decision based on association.Looking at a pile of cash before a conversation can make us greedyA bilboard with some imposing eyes can lower bad behaviourHolding our finger in the mouth forms a smile that sparks a little bit of joyUnfortunately, a strongly primed System One cand fool System Two into believing it's story.
