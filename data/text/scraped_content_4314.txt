Title: Narcissists Will Catch Our Eye Content: In spite of the exhibitionism, arrogance, vanity and a massive superiority complex, narcissists seem attractive, and alluring to a large section of people.This surprising outcome may be due to people confusing narcissism with positive self-worth and high self-esteem.
Title: The First Impression Content: While people perceive narcissism to be an undesirable quality in others, the first impression that gets created in seeing a narcissist is a positive one.It may be due to the narcissists strategically presenting themselves in ways in which they are perceived having high levels of self-esteem.
Title: Emerging Zone and Enduring Zone Content: Narcissists may seem alluring because they seem like a catch, living in the 'emerging zone' of life, which manifests itself in parties, early-stage relationships, and places where making a good first impression is key.When narcissists move towards the 'enduring zone', which involves continuing a relationship, and long-term consequences, they start behaving arrogantly and negatively.
Title: Self-Esteem in Dating and Politics Content: Dating profiles report more attraction towards the flashy narcissists who show off their 'sex-appeal' upfront.Even in politics, people tend to gravitate towards candidates who show positive self-esteem or narcissism.A flashy attire, or showing off while dating is a trait of narcissists, not of those with healthy self-esteem, who have a stable sense of worth.It is crucial that we accurately distinguish between narcissism and healthy self-esteem, both as a perceiver and as a person addicted to esteem.
