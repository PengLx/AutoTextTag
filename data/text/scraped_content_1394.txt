Health,Food
Title: Paleo concept Content: Humans evolved on a diet very different from today's eating habits.To be healthier, leaner, stronger and fitter, we must re-think our diet and remove some of the food groups we consider basic.ExceptPaleo fans tend to overlook the fact that hunter-gatherers were not models of pristine health. Palaeolithic humans suffered from parasites, infectious diseases, and even atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).
Title: What to eat  Content: Animals (especially a "whole animal" approach, including organs, bone marrow, cartilage, and organs).Animal products (such as eggs or honey).Vegetables and fruits.Raw nuts and seeds.Added fats (like coconut oil, avocado, butter, ghee).
Title: What to avoid Content: Grains, althoughresearch suggests eating whole grains improve our health and appear to be neutral when it comes to inflammation.Heavily processed oils,such as canola and soybean oil.Legumes, although research suggests the benefits of legumes outweigh their anti-nutrient content. Cooking eliminates most anti-nutrient effects. Some anti-nutrients may even be good.Dairy.
Title: The problem with Paleo Content: The evolutionary arguments don't hold up.Evidence for excluding dairy, legumes, and grains isn't strong (yet).A one-size-fits-all "best diet" approach doesn't work.
