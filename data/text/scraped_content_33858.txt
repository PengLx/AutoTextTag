Title: How To Help Frazzled Employees Content: The never-ending status of the ongoing pandemic has made the working population jaded and uncertain about the future, as they juggle work, child care and many other challenges. The trick to deploy is to ensure that things go smoothly and employees can recharge themselves and find new energy to meet the upcoming challenges.
Title: Finding What Employees Really Need Content: Each employee is having a unique set of problems and challenges. Some are homeschooling kids while working, others are handling home affairs while their spouse is on overdrive due to the increased demands of the job. One size will not fit all, and a manager has to craft tailored solutions.
Title: If Work Permits, Take A Leave Content: Taking a few days or weeks of leave(if it is agreeable by your manager or is even possible otherwise) is the best way to recharge and prevent burnout. Many employees do not realize this as they fear job loss.
Title: Acknowledge And Reward The Stand-Out Employees Content: Many employees are picking up the slack and doing extra work, while also managing their home. The manager needs to acknowledge and reward them so that they feel valued.
Title: Listen To Your Employees Content: A Manager needs to overcommunicate and demonstrate true concern towards all employees. One can evaluate the stress each one is facing by having regular one-on-ones where the manager is simply listening, and looking for signs of stress.
