Title: The Elusive Butterfly Called Happiness Content: Happiness is an enigma, an elusive butterfly. Different people experience this fleeting feeling in diverse ways.The extrovert personality types have a stronger, more positive link towards happiness, as compared to the neurotics. It is hard to pinpoint if the extrovert types are happier or the serene, placid types, who are content with little.Some people are happy with spending time alone and even self-actualization, which is considered low-intensity and 'boring' by the extroverts.
Title: Don't Chase Happiness Content: Understandably, pain, pleasure, and loneliness can make us unhappy, and pleasures can provide us with momentary happiness.A certain dissatisfaction, want and frustration, is, strangely enough, providing a background towards being happy. Fulfillment of all desires, and having nothing to pursue, paradoxically makes us unhappy.It can be said that happiness is intended pleasure, and absence of pain, but if we are trying too hard to be happy, we cease to be so.
Title: You Cannot Bottle Happiness Content: All of us, no matter what is our state of affairs, experience dissatisfaction, frustration and other unpleasant emotions. These emotions are as essential as one's feeling of euphoria when good things happen.Happiness is a journey, a never-ending quest, which cannot be simply captured, bought or sold.
