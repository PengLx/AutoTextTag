Title: Small wins compound over time Content: They make big goals seem manageable and achievable.They also help you to move closer to where you want to be and a constant source of motivation.
Title: Pair big goals with small wins Content: Do this to ensure daily progress and motivation.Because big goals can be demotivating: that burst of excitement at the beginning quickly wears off. Small wins keep your eyes on the process, not the result and help you see the progress you're making.
Title: Small wins criteria Content: They need little time: they have to be small and achievable in preferably under 10 minutes (more than that and you will start to lose motivation)They need little effort: they have to be so effortless, that you'll feel bad for not achieving them.The less effort you need to complete your small win the fewer excuses you’ll allow yourself
Title: Practicing small wins daily Content: Start small and once you feel comfortable, ramp things up.Consistency is key, so do them daily.Same time and locations: you’re already trying to form a new behavior so keep the other variables constant.Insert them into a routine:a simple way to ensure you’ll practice your new habit. 
Title: Beat procrastination with small wins Content: Procrastination boils down to getting started.Small wins force you to get started, over and over again. Every day they will force you to get started on your new habit. And because it’s so small and so simple, you will.
