Title: Cognitive Bias Content: Cognitive Bias is a predictable pattern of mental errors where we misperceive reality and move away from the most likely way of reaching our goals.These mental blind spots impact all areas of life. Cognitive biases have to do with judgment, not mood.
Title: Unconscious Bias Content: Unconscious bias refers to unconscious forms of discrimination and stereotyping. Unconscious bias often leads to discrimination, be it deliberate or unintentional. Unconscious bias is different from cognitive biases. Cognitive biases relate to our brains' particular wiring, while unconscious bias refers to perceptions between different groups and are specific to different societies.
Title: How to Reduce Unconscious Bias Content:  Recognise that the unconscious bias is a systemic issue. Internal cultures need to be checked and addressed first. There is no shame or guilt in unconscious bias. Unconscious bias stems from our tendency to categorise people into social groups and often doesn't match our conscious values.   It takes a series of conversations and interventions to prevent and protect against unconscious bias.
