Title: Automation and Future of Jobs Content: Economists have been long worried that automation will take away our jobs. As old kinds of jobs disappear due to technology and automation, new kinds of work started emerging.The rising cases of stress and burnout due to more hours of work is contrary to what should have happened due to automation: less working hours.
Title: "Bad" Jobs Content: A growing number of workers are increasingly dissatisfied and underwhelmed with their seemingly fancy job profiles as bankers, tax-advisors, and all the garden variety managers, whose job is to add to the bottom line of a company.These kinds of jobs don't add value to the world and serve no real purpose.
Title: The Meaning of Life Content: The meaning of life is to make this world a little nicer, more beautiful and maybe more interesting, mainly through what we do.
Title: A Narrow Definition of Work Content: Capitalism ensures only if we generate money can the work we do have any real, measurable value.Education systems prepare us to be the pawns of the employment sector.Such work can start to appear pointless to a lot of people.
Title: Universal Basic Income Content: If the definition of real work changes, with the real benefits of automation and technology (like the Universal Basic Income) providing us the Utopia that is long-promised, then we may start to do work that is meaningful.
