Title: Wim Hof Method ‚Äì Biology of Breathing Content: Alongside cold showers and ice baths , a major part of the Wim Hof Method is a breathing technique with the following sequence:30 deep breaths faster than normal pace (controlled hyperventilation)Holding the breath at neutral lung pressure for as long as you can do so comfortablyA short breath hold for about 15 seconds with the lungs full of air

What are the real benefits and why? Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the biology. 
Title: Phase #1: Controlled Hyperventilation Content: The main purpose of this phase is to reduce the CO2 levels as much as possible while remaining in a relaxed state. Take very deep breaths (‚Äúfully in‚Äù)Breathe out as relaxed as possible by simply relaxing the lungs (‚Äúlet it go‚Äù / ‚Äúnever force‚Äù)Breathe somewhat more quickly than naturalThree common sensations that people experience in these situations are tingling and light-headedness . For some individuals in very deep sessions they might also experience muscle cramps such as the thumb and fingers getting tense. Why does this happen?Tingling: these pins-and-needles feelings are from the nerves randomly firing, ultimately caused by the low CO2 levels in the blood.Light-headedness & muscle cramps: usually, hemoglobin collects O2 at the lungs and releases it around the body. However when the CO2 level is low, the O2 attaches too strongly to the hemoglobin (known as the Bohr Effect) and so the O2 isn‚Äôt released so much to the cells that require it.
Title: Phase #2: Retention at neutral lung pressure Content: The purpose of this phase is to decrease the blood O2 level from ~100% to a safe but unnaturally low level for a short period of time. The body responds to this short stress in a variety of very positive ways (a valid example of hormesis ) ‚Äì that form the majority of the health benefits of this exercise.However your body is using up O2 throughout the retention, so after about 1 minute your blood O2 is lower than it can normally get. When the O2 level drops far enough, it triggers the body into doing a couple of cool things:After (very approximately) 90 seconds, a significant amount of adrenaline (epinephrine) is produced.The hypoxia-inducible factor 1a gene is expressed, to help the body make adjustments to better thrive in a low-O2 environment.
Title: Phase #3: Recovery breath (short retention on full inhale) Content: When we finally need to breathe, we take a very deep breath and hold for about 15 seconds. The purpose of this is to quickly reset the body‚Äôs O2 levels . As the blood CO2 levels are now at normal or elevated levels, the body will use this O2 efficiently (again, due to the Bohr Effect).Most practitioners of this breathing technique could hold this retention much longer than 15 seconds, but Wim Hof recommends this length of time for an efficient reset. Too long, and O2 levels will start to drop again.At the end you should feel a natural ‚Äúhigh‚Äù feeling mainly from the relaxation and adrenaline üôÇ
Title: (1) Benefits from stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system during the deep breaths: Content: Reduced stress during the exercise and for some time afterwardsIncreased heart-rate variability (HRV)
Title: (2) Benefits from the hypoxia (low O2) during the retention: Content: More red blood cells are produced so the body can transport O2 more efficiently in the future, so you‚Äôll feel like you have more energy Athletes benefit from the red blood cells for short endurance sports, such as football and middle-distance foot races ‚Äì increased VO2 max You can acclimatize to high altitudes before arriving because of the additional red blood cellsStem cells are able to move more easily around the body to help with repair and anti-aging [still unconfirmed but has been shown in rats to increase neural cell regeneration in the brain]The body also produces more mitochondria ‚Äì the part of the cell that produces creates energy ‚Äì because it is preparing in case it needs to perform anaerobic respiration in the futureThe hypoxia-inducible factor 1a has been shown to help mice readjust their circadian rhythm ‚Äì so it may help shift workers and people suffering from jet lag
Title: (3) Benefits from the adrenaline release during the retention: Content: Increased white blood cells ‚Äì in fact many people who regularly perform this breathing technique report that they almost never get sickReduced inflammation ‚Äì this can help to some extent with many medical issues such as:Crohn‚Äôs diseaseDepressionJoint injuriesRheumatoid arthritisCortisol (the stress hormone) decreases a few hours after the exercise and stays lower all day
Title: Dangers of the Wim Hof Method Breathing Content: During Phase #2 (the retention) it can occasionally happen that your O2 levels get too low before you feel the urge to breathe caused by the high CO2. When this happens you will lose consciousness briefly, begin to breathe normally and wake up wondering why your retention was longer than usual. This is nothing to worry about (take it easier next time!) but because of this there are some situations where it is dangerous and irresponsible to perform this method:Swimming: in this case you will drown and dieDriving: in this case you can cause an accidentIn the shower or anywhere standing: in this case you can fall and hurt yourselfThe dangers are serious enough that free-divers are banned from using this technique for their dives.
