Title:  Content: The crux of my approach to couple’s therapy is relevant here. Regardless of what the couple is struggling with, and regardless of the theoretical approach I choose, one thing I am always doing is monitoring their treatment of each other and especially what they say to each other. If one of them says something that strikes me as a sour note, I make the “time-out” sign. I say something like, "Is that the way a spouse talks to (or about) a spouse (or a wife to a wife or whatever)?" If they say no, I invite the person to try again, this time speaking as one does to (or about) one’s spouse.Couples can benefit from the time-out sign. Be careful not to use it when your partner says something you disagree with; only use it when you disagree with the way they said it. Then talk about what kind of relationship their way of speaking promotes and what kind of relationship the two of you want to have.If nothing else, the friendly, collaborative time-out space will be a good place to reconnect. Of course, the time-out sign has to be used at the outset of a misstep. If you ignore the first time you are spoken to like you are a kindergartner, you are likely to respond childishly, and then by the time you make the time-out sign, you’re in a full-blown fight. Still, once things settle down, you can try to locate together when the couple went off the rails of marriage and onto the tantrum track, and you can review the advantages of calling for time-outs when things start.
