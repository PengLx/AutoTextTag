Title: Only give advice when asked Content: Unsolicited advice sends a message that you're jumping in because they can't handle the problem. It leaves them feeling less competent and capable, undermining their ability to handle the situation themselves.To ensure that your advice is more helpful than harmful, only share it if you're explicitly asked.
Title: Offer information Content: When giving advice, people with more experience often make the mistake of assuming that they know best.To offer expertise in a way that's truly helpful, use it to inform the person about the decision at hand.Tell them what you know about their options, possibly offering a recommendation, then let them use that information to make a sound decision.
Title: Help think through the problem Content: Instead of imposing your opinion, guide them through the process you might use to reach a conclusion. Ask the questions you would ask yourself, and give them an opportunity to talk through the options with you. That approach will help build problem-solving skills that translate to future dilemmas.
Title: Express confidence Content: If someone comes to you for advice, let them know that youâ€™re here to help but you trust them to make an intelligent decision. Your confidence may be all the advice they need.
