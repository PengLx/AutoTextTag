Title: Everyone should know why they've gathered Content: Set the agenda for the meeting. It can be summarized on a handout, written on a whiteboard, or discussed explicitly at the outset.While it may seem obvious to set an agenda, many meetings start with no clear idea of the purpose. 
Title: Start and end the meeting on time Content: Start at a predetermined time. Not a minute later. Sitting around trying to guess when the meeting will start is a waste of a precious resource. Busy people should be able to discipline themselves to be there on time.Ending on time is just as important. It will help ensure you accomplish what's on your agenda.
Title: End with an action plan Content: Leave the last few minutes of every meeting to discuss the next steps.This includes deciding who is responsible for that task and what the deadlines are.
