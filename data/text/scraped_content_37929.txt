Within a few years, the first journal of experimental psychology got published, called the Journal Philosophische Studien.Earlier psychological musings contribute to modern psychology, like the mind-body related reflections by the Greeks, or Thomas Hobbes and his views on materialism.
Title: The Many Beginnings Of Psychology Content: Before the birth of modern psychology, Gustav Fechner conducted psychological experiments based on our various sensations.Pierre Flourens conducted experiments on animals by damaging their brains and observing the changes.Ivan Pavlovâ€™s various experiments(like the Salivating Dogs) led to a better understanding of the history, conditioning and behaviour patterns of psychology.I.M Sechenov wrote Reflexes Of The Brain, arguing that even complex behaviours are just reflexes.A couple of decades before Wilhelm Wundt, William James established a psychological lab and also wrote The Principles Of Psychology.
