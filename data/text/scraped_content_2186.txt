Title: Responding with a clear mind Content: Responding meansnot jumping to conclusions, seeing the situation from every angle and accepting that your opinion may not be the only one or even the best one.Revamping your response mechanism will afford you many benefits. And with a clear mind, you’ll be able to confidently make the best decisions for your growing venture.
Title: Collect yourself Content: Before reacting, pause and allow your initial emotional reaction to pass.Then address the opportunity again, and see how you respond differently. Repeat this process, giving yourself time to work through your old conditioning. Consider going for a drive/a walk. This will give you time to relax and settle your thoughts.
Title: Tune in to your feelings Content: Clarity is tough when you’re under pressure, so never make an important decision when you’re feeling anxious.If you’re not physically or emotionally up to the task, put off making a move until you’re in the right state of mind.
Title: Move around Content: Besides giving you time to think, physical activity helps dispel that anxious energy. This creates solutions from a clean sheet, rather than inside the problem.
