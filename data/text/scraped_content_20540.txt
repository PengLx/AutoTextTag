Title: Emotional Intellectualization Content: As adults, the way we express ourselves is ruining our natural feelings. Words are misused to explain something which we feel from the inside, as a primitive defence mechanism to avoid further painful feelings.This leads us to be unaware of our true feelings, which get distorted or mutated due to the words used intellectually. Having labels and syndromes for everything doesn’t help either.
Title: Trying To Control Our Emotions Content: Emotions are not easy to be directly controlled, and in trying to do so, people may make it worse. But the most common advice provided by friends and family is to control one’s emotions or to manage one’s mood. Accepting your emotions instead of controlling or suppressing them may be painful in the beginning but is a more holistic approach.
Title: Judging Our Emotions Content: Our judgement of emotions, something extremely common, is the fastest way to end up in a therapist's office. Getting judgemental never works in making you feel better. It is not a good idea to feel bad about feeling bad while you are feeling bad.
Title: Running Away From Our Emotions Content: Pain by itself isn’t dangerous but is only a signal about something else that needs your attention. Killing pain never killed the actual problem, just like painkillers do not work on the real reason for the pain, but only blunt the sensory input to the brain.Instead of using your energy to escape emotional pain, it is better to address the real issue behind it.
Title: Go For Values, Not Emotions When Making Decisions Content: Emotions provide us signals and sometimes those can be incorrect. It is better to let your values be your guiding light and ignore a few emotional signals of discomfort.Good things have some costs involved. If we want the best things in life, we have to pay the price, and sometimes it requires us to feel bad too.
