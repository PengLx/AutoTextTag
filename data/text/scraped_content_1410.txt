Title: Stop Procrastinating With the “2-Minute Rule” Content: The Rule states “When you start a new habit, it should take less than 2 minutes to do.”So break down your habits into tasks that can be accomplished within 2 minutes.The idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start. Making a task from a habit short makes it feel less like a challenge and it works as a “gateway habit” that leads you down a more productive path.
Title: Why The 2-Minute Rule Works Content: The point is not to do one thing, but to master the habit of showing up. A habit must be established before it can be improved. Mastering the art of showing up, the first 2 minutes become a ritual at the beginning of a larger routine. This is the ideal way to master a difficult skill. The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things.
Title: If the 2-Minute Rule Feels Forced To You Content: ... try this: do something you want to make into a habit for 2 minutes and then stop. And keep repeating.This reinforces the identity you want to build and, eventually, you will feel like it’s a waste of time to do only the two minutes and will invest more time on.
