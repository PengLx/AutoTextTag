Perhaps the commute also offers an opportunity to engage in deeper levels of creativity.Globally, the average commuting time is 38 minutes each way. That adds up to a lot of time, which may offer a chance to read, listen to a podcast, audiobooks, or playing Scrabble.It also allows time for boredom where the mind can wander, which can produce original thoughts and also problem-solving.During the evening commute, one has time for reflection after the working day is done.
Title: Replacing the commute Content: Many are starting to miss the sanctuary of their car on their long commutes to work, where they could eat in calm or catch up on calls and messages.To adjust to the new working-from- home reality, small daily rituals may help, e.g., putting on work clothes to start your day and change when it is done. Setting your intentions for the day and ending on time is another to help you adjust.
