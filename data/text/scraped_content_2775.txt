Title: Do Content: Simply put, act on your tasks. The 2-minute rule can help with that: If you can complete a task in two minutes or less, do it now. It's amazing what you can accomplish in just 120 seconds: write an email, make a quick phone call, pull a report and so on.
Title: Delete Content: You don't have to do much of anything beyond making a simple decision to do or to delete.If the deleted item is a simple activity that won't bring you results, remove it from your to-do list and move on with your day. The second most pleasing thing after completing a to-do list is removing an item from it.
Title: Defer Content: To defer means saying, "Not right now" rather than, "Not ever." This could be a new project you want to com mence in a week or two or it could be van idea you want to reflect on before taking action.But be careful, there'sa fine line between deferring and procrastinating indefinitely.
Title: Delegate Content: You might find it disconcerting when the results are somewhat different than when you complete the work yourself.To delegate effectively, create a playbook breaking down a project or task step-by-step and detailing what the outcome looks like.
