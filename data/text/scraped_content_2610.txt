Title: Knowledge And Results Content: New knowledge does not necessarily drive new results, especially if your goal is to make progress and not to simply gain additional knowledge.The gap between where you are now and where you are in the future is not always caused by the lack of knowledge.
Title: Learning vs. Practicing Content: Passive learning creates knowledge. Active practice creates skills.
Title: Passive Learning Supports Inaction Content: Some of us use learning as a way to avoid doing the actual work toward reaching our goals. In this case, it becomes a form of procrastination.We claim in these situations that we are preparing or researching the best methods and practices to reach our goals.
Title: Practice Is Learning Content: ... but learning is not practice. Unless you apply that knowledge and make a meaningful contribution with it, passive learning is not a form of practice.Making mistakes while practising is a great form of learning, because it helps you gain important insights.
Title: Practice And Focus  Content: Practice focuses your energy on the process.It is not the things we learn nor our dreams and aspirations that determine our results, but rather those habits that we practice each day. Focus your energy on the process, not the product.
