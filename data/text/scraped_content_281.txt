Title: Meditation isn’t specifically about happiness Content: Happiness is a likely side effect. It expands one’s freedom in a particular way, and this freedom can be used to pursue happiness and ease with much less trouble.
Title: Ultimate Freedom = Detachment of emotional reaction from experiences Content: There is a difference between an experience and how we perceive it. We tend to label everything in shades of personal appeal. Freedom, enabled by mindfulness, is about recognising this distinction and observing the moment as it is.
