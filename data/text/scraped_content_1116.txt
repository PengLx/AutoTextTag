Title: If you believe things about yourself like… Content: “It's hard for me to lose weight.”“I'm not good with numbers.”“I'm not a natural athlete.”“I'm not creative.”“I'm a procrastinator.”...it's clear that those fixed mindsets will cause you to avoid experiences where you might feel like a failure. As a result, you don't learn as much and it's hard to get better.
Title: Actions change your beliefs Content: It's your daily actions that will change what you believe about yourself and the person you become.Focus on the process. Focus on showing up, on sticking to the schedule, on “not quitting.”Eventually, the results and the self–confidence will come anyway.
