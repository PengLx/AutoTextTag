Title: We see things differently Content: Two people can look at the exact same situation and see it completely differently.
Title: We see life as we are, not as it is Content: There is no objective reality when it comes to people.Facts may be facts, but our viewpoint and our vantage point impact our ability to process the facts. We look at life through our own personal filters, our own past experiences, beliefs, and paradigms.
Title: Giving in relationships Content: If you do something for someone just because they did it for you or you want something back, you are doing business, not kindness.If you choose to give 300 percent, then go for it, regardless of what others give you in return.  
Title: We don't have to attend every drama we’re invited to Content: Preserve your energy for your goals, passions, purpose, and doing more good. If you feel you’re getting sucked into drama (gossip or unnecessary conflict) take a step back and pull away.
