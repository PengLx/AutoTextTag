Title: Give Them Your Respect Content: Don’t assume a defensive position towards your employees or extrapolate that they’re going to be jealous, disrespectful, and bitter toward you.Let go of your assumptions, check your ego at the door, and convey how much you respect and value your employees so they will be more accepting of you. Remember, it’s only combining skills that you can move the company forward.
Title: Be Honest Content: If someone asks you something that you don’t know the answer to, be honest. By providing an answer that you think is correct but isn’t—you (and your employee) could end up in an even worse position, and you’ll quickly lose your team’s respect.But don’t just say you don’t know. Tell your employees that you’ll find out from someone who does.
Title: Learn From Them Content: Your employees also had a first day and they know how it feels to be the fish out of water.So during your first few weeks, sit with each of your employees, watch their daily routines, and ask about what they’re doing and talking about. They’ll enjoy demonstrating their knowledge, and you’ll learn more than you would from a training manual.
Title: Ask For Their Feedback Content: Employees who have been with a company for more than 10 years have inevitably seen processes change time and again. They’ve seen what works, what needs improvement, and what will never change.Ask experienced team members for their opinions and ideas—they’ll often lead to issues and concerns that you hadn’t thought of and even solutions to them. But don’t let it turn into fruitless ranting.
