Any object will do.If you’re stuck on finding a subject, follow a prompt ( e.g. Inktober’s “prompt list": words are meant to spark your imagination on each day of the month).Try sketching your meeting notes. Use as few words as possible.Start with something easy like drawing on a greeting card or drawing a small caricature of your face after your signature.
