Title: No big meetings Content: Don't hold large meetings, except if they are providing value to everyone. Then keep the meeting short.A typical meeting should involve no more than 4 - 6 people. Before you send out your next invite list ask: Who on this list will add (or receive) the most value? Is there anyone who doesn't need to be there?
Title: No added value Content: If you are invited to a meeting but realize that you do not add value, leave.This advice might at first seem shocking, but if the whole team can view this rule as beneficial and use it tactfully, it can help build authenticity and transparency in an organization.
Title: No frequent meetings Content: Get rid of regular meetings unless you are dealing with a pressing matter. Once the issue is resolved, the meeting frequency should drop.Ask yourself how urgent the need behind the meeting is and if you can instead reduce the frequency and communicate via email or group chat.
