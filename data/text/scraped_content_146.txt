Title: Intentionally working with goals Content: Think of your goal as an intention, not as a fixed path;If you notice you are attached to the fantasy of your goal, bring your focus to the present and what you can do now, in line with yout intention;Allow yourself to be flexibile - you can shift as you learn more;If/when you do arrive at your destination, stop and be present with it, appreciating your journey, appreciating where you are, without immediately turning to the next thing.
Title: Goals as tools Content: Goals are not the answer to everything, but neither are they evil. Theyâ€™re simply tools.And like any tool, they can be used to bludgeon ourselves over the head with shame and guilt, or can be used with intention, as a way to consciously deep our practice in life.
