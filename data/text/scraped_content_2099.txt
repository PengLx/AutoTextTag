Title: Your brain is the biggest obstacle. Content: There are lazy people, slackers, and folks who don’t step up, but generally, human beings are hardwired to hang in, not to leave or quit.What’s hard for human beings is letting go.
Title: The most common biases Content: You’re focused on the time and energy you’ve already invested, or the sunk cost fallacy.Your eyes are trained on positive cues -being overly optimistic and loss averse. Always trying harder and for longer.When we realize we’re likely to fail at a job or other endeavor, we begin to see that goal as even more valuable than it was initially.FOMO—and the fear of making a mistake.
Title: Do this if you want to quit Content: Get a bead on your emotions. Don’t set yourself up for a “straw-that-broke-the-camel’s back” moment.Motivate yourself. Quitting isn’t an end in and of itself; it’s a pathway to a new destination.Make a plan that not only sets your new goal but anticipates possible setbacks and pitfalls along the way.Prepare for the stress of transition. The best defence is knowing ahead of time how you’re likely to react.
