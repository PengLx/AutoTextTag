Title: Priming the Environment Content: Whenever you organize a space for its intended purpose, you are priming it to make the next action easy. This is one of the most practical and simple ways to improve your habits.
Title: Ideas to prime your environment Content: To draw more: Put your pencils, pens, notebooks, and drawing tools on top of your desk, within easy reach.To exercise more:Set out your workout clothes, shoes, gym bag, and water bottle ahead of time.To improve your diet:Chop up a ton of fruits and vegetables on weekends and pack them in containers, so you have easy access to healthy, ready-to-eat options during the week.
Title: Make bad behaviors difficult Content: If you watch too much television, unplug it after each use. Only plug it back in if you can say out loud the name of the show you want to watch. (Which prevents you from turning on Netflix and “just finding something” to watch.) This setup creates just enough friction to prevent mindless viewing.
