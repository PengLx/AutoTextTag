Title: Doomscrolling Content: This is a term that describes the habit of endlessly scrolling social media and news feeds full of doom and gloom on one’s smartphone screen, something which is eroding our mental health.This self-destructive behaviour has become increasingly common in 2020 due to the dystopian stories and articles related to the pandemic available online and the fact that many people are jobless and sitting at home.
Title: The Threat Cycle Content: One feels anxious and wants to hook the mind back to the doom and threat cycle, to gather more information.The more time we spend doomscrolling, the more dangers and threats we stumble upon, skewing our perspective of the outside world. 
Title: Ways To Temper The Doom Content: Set A Timer: Your social media and news feeds can be timed using the built-in utilities of the smartphone that shut off the app for the day after a certain time.Stay On Focus: Stay aware while you fire up your smartphone for what you are looking for, and refrain yourself from getting distracted towards the assortment of notifications and enticing app icons.Positive Emotions: Instead of focussing on ‘doom and gloom’, try to default towards the good, like connecting with friends and loved ones, or reading something that makes you laugh, and sending it to friends.
