Title: Steve Job's effectiveness boiled down to this: Content: He inspired team members firstso that they were driven to live up to his exacting standards when the situation called for it.Get this equation backwards and you will wonder why your employees disengage or drop out when you present tough challenges.
Title: The formula for being an inspirational driver Content: Know your "noble cause."Jobs understood that if teams don’t find their work meaningful, they perceive challenging directives from a leader as arbitrary demands rather than a call to sacrifice for a higher purpose.Tell your story early and often.If you can’t weave your ideas into a clear, compelling story, those ideas remain abstract words likely to be forgotten.Push, but within boundaries.
