Title: Healing from control Content: Whether you're the controller or the one being controlled, it is possible to move forward and make changes for the better.Be wary of their actions and yours. Think about everything you do and ask yourself "what if" you were the one receiving the action.Be considerate. Remember that the only behavior we are responsible for is our own and the choices we make based on that.Practice self-reflection. It is important to know what you have to offer and ask yourself what they can help fulfill.
