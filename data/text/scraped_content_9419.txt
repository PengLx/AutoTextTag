The new virus also binds to the type 2 pneumocytes. If you have less type 2 pneumocytes, your lungs are already under stress. If you smoke and contract the virus, you're going to be worse off.
Title: Effects on the immune system Content: There are over 100 cannabinoids in the cannabis plant. Most interact with the immune system, but research on the effects of cannabinoids on the immune system is contradictory.While some of these compounds do appear to have anti-inflammatory properties in preclinical studies, it has not been proven to be effective against the new virus or other viral infections.
