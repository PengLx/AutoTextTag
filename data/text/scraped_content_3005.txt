Title: For decision-making success: Content: Book time to think: It’s counterintuitive, but making decisions faster requires consciously giving yourself time to make them.Define the decision: Before delving into deciding, get clear on the nature of the choice you’re making.Think through your options: Instead of limiting yourself to a “yes” or “no” choice, brainstorm all the possible options before making a decision.
Title: Fall back on your values Content: Having clear values that you try to live by can make tough decisions easier.For example, maybe you know there’s a certain amount of time you want to spend with your family, or a baseline level of debt you’re willing to carry.
Title: Talk it through Content: You don’t need to speak with someone who’s knowledgeable on the topic.You just need a good listener who’ll give you time and space to hear out your monologue and occasionally reflect back to you what you’ve shared.
Title: Ask for perspective Content: Asking someone else for their opinion typically works best when you’re considering doing something that you’ve never done before, and when you know someone who’s experienced in that domain.
Title: Test it out first Content: In some cases, you can test out a decision before actually making it.For example, considervisiting a new city to see how it feels to you, before taking that job that would require you to relocate. 
Title: Listen to your hopes Content: When you’re really struggling with a decision, it’s often because your mind thinks one thing is practical while your heart wants something else.We’re not purely rational creatures.It’s ok to listen to your hopes because they often give you deeper insight into the decisions you actually want to make.
