Title: 4 Reasons Giving Constructive Criticism Goes Bad Content: You’re not offering anything constructive if all you do is point out problems. You can still direct attention to an issue, but make sure that you follow up with a helpful suggestion.You’re offering unrequested input. Before speaking up, ask yourself if this is something that really even requires your input or if your input is properly qualified for the situation.You’re starting all wrong if you open with “No offense, but…” “Don’t take this the wrong way, but…” “This might sound really mean, but…” These introductions function as an advanced warning for rude or overly personal words to come.You’re too aggressive on how you deliver your message. To avoid it, maintain a happy and friendly tone with open body language. Also, choose words that clarify you are making suggestions—not demands, like using “might” or “could” instead of “should”.
