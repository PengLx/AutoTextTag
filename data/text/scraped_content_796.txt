Teamwork,Communication,Personal Development
Title: Over-communicate Content: Assume that people don’t know what you’re thinking.And you’ll find the more you communicate with others, the more they will reciprocate.Ask questions, tell the team what you’re doing, be responsive, and get over that you think you’re bugging them too much. The more you communicate, the shorter the physical distance between you appears.
Title: Share Frequently and Get Feedback Content: Constantly send screenshots and ideas. Give your team a glimpse into your head throughout the day so they can see your creative process.Share your unfinished work in progress. A single reply from a teammate can steer your entire project in a better direction. Get feedback on your work early on so you can evolve sooner.
Title: Build Trust Content: Build trust in your team by constantly reminding them how dependable you are.You can do this by being the first one to respond in threads, providing your feedback, leading initiatives, and not just delivering your work on time, but delivering it early.
Title: Share Your Opinion Content: People have short term memories, so keep making clear the fact that you’re here and you have an opinion.Provide feedback on other people’s work and be convicted, without ego.
Title: Set Expectations Content: It’s up to you to make sure your team knows how to work best with you.If they aren’t regularly sharing progress with you, bug them. Ask them questions every day. Make it known that your awareness matters a lot, and affects the outcome of the project.
