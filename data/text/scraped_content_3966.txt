Title: Confirm with everyone Content: It's not uncommon for hiring managers to hand you over to someone else on the team to meet you at the last minute. Send a quick email to encourage them to plan:Hi Kamala, I’m really excited to come in on Tuesday. I just wanted to confirm that I’ll be speaking with you and Jarrod. Could you please let me know if there’s anyone else I should look forward to meeting? Thanks so much!
Title: The interviewer’s LinkedIn and Twitter Content: Skim their history on LinkedIn, then move way down to the bottom. If they have endorsements and recommendations, it can give you a feel for their management style.Twitter can help you guess at an interviewer's personality, interests, and values.
Title: Your “about me” answer Content: Your interviewer will probably open with some form of "Tell me a little about yourself."Plan your answer using a few quick bullet points to keep things brief en then commit it loosely to memory.Skip your personal history.Give two or three sentences about your career path.Mention how you decided to apply to this job.Leave enough curiosity that the interviewer becomes excited to learn more about you.
Title: One great question Content: Think about the no.1 thing you really want to know. Line that question up to pose to the hiring manager.Just being curious is a marketable job skill.For instance, the question could be about the expectations for the role, career advancement, something to help you understand the company culture, or even a qualitative question like, "Why do you see X as important?"
