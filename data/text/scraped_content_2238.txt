Title: What forgiveness is Content: Forgiveness does not mean forgetting or minimising the pain we feel; nor is it about excusing others.Forgiveness means making a conscious and deliberate decision to let go of our feelings of resentment or revenge, regardless of whether the person who has upset us deserves it.
Title: A proper apology Content: One thing that often helps people to forgive is receiving an apology.A good apology ideally has three parts: an admission of responsibility, a demonstration of sorrow, and doing something to remedy the offence, or prevent a repetition of it.
Title: Apologies and understanding Content: An apology is not telling others we feel sorry they are angryit is telling them we understand why they are angry with us, regret making them feel that way, and wanting to take their anger away.An effective apology is showing the person we understand why they are hurting.
Title: Prioritise your safety Content: Forgiving ourselves is always good. But forgiving others is only beneficial if the advantages exceed the potential costs. We should therefore not forgive others if that might expose us to further abuse or exploitation.The stress response we experience to being hurt is protective because it motivates us to stop people from abusing or taking advantage of us.
