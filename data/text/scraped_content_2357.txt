Title: Improve your diet and start moving Content: Wholefoods such as leafy green vegetables, legumes, whole grains, lean red meat, and seafood, provide nutrients that are important for optimal brain function.Many types of fitness activities are potentially beneficial – from swimming to jogging to lifting weights or playing sports. Even just getting the body moving by taking a walk or doing active housework is a positive step.
Title: Reduce your vices Content: People with alcohol and drug problems have a greater likelihood than average of having a mental illness and have far poorer health outcomes.Stopping smoking is an important step, as nicotine-addicted people are constantly at the mercy of a withdrawal-craving cycle, which profoundly affects mood.
Title: Prioritize rest and sleep Content: Sleep hygiene techniques aim to improve sleep quality and help treat insomnia.They include: adjusting caffeine use, limiting exposure to the bed (regulating your sleep time and having a limited time to sleep), limiting exposure to the blue light from smartphones, and making sure you get up at a similar time in the morning.
Title: Get a dose of nature Content: Adequate exposure to sunshine helps levels of the mood-maintaining chemical serotonin.It also boosts vitamin D levels, which also has an effect on mental health, and helps at the appropriate time to regulate our sleep-wake cycle.
Title: Reach out when you need help Content: Positive lifestyle changes aren’t a replacement for medication or psychological therapy but, rather, as something people can undertake themselves on top of their treatment.While many lifestyle changes can be positive, some changes (such as avoiding junk foods, alcohol, or giving up smoking) may be challenging if being used as a psychological crutch.
