Title: The KonMari process Content: Summed up, it goes like this: you go through every possession you own, hold it in your hands, and keep it only if it evokes some kind of “joy”.The theory is that any possession that gives you bad or mixed feelings is too costly to have in your life, if it’s possible to get rid of it.
Title: Every possession is a relationship Content: So it makes sense to carefully consider what we keep in our homes.Most of us own lots of things that make us feel bad (unused gifts, clothes we don't like or that don't fit, books we’ll never read, etc). And if it’s normal to have hundreds or thousands of possessions, then we are each, at all times, bearing the weight of hundreds or thousands of these relationships.
Title: Decisions about your identity Content: Getting rid of stuff can be quite liberating. Much of this process is about deciding who you are and who you’re not going to be.You can’t move forward when you’re trying to keep a foot in every door.
Title: What you 'need' to keep Content: You will eventually find a lot of things that you need to keep, despite the fact they bring no joy. To help address this, keep a running list of things you want to replace with a more pleasing version.
Title: The psychology of owning stuff Content: Our possessions are more psychological than physical.What a thing is is much less important than what it does to your mind when you own it.
