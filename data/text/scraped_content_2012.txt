Title: Experiment And Learn Content: Complexity calls for a series of safe-to-fail experiments–little bets that we can use to nudge the system in the desired direction. Instead of picking a final destination and trying to close the gaps, try finding places for experimentation and learning.The experiments should be small, inexpensive, and most importantly they should be things you can learn from.
Title: Consider The Bigger Picture Content: We tend to pull things apart and solve the pieces one at a time. But complex systems have too many variables for a reductionist approach to work perfectly.If you find yourself being drawn to the minutiae, try to find the patterns. When you feel yourself bouncing back and forth between two details, instead of thinking of them as opposites, see what balance you can strike between the two sides.
Title: Accept Multiple Perspectives Content: You need to seek out different perspectives and not try to convince anyonethat you’re right.You can tell you’re not taking someone’s perspective into consideration if you think of him as not getting it. Try holding back on forming an opinion and instead actively listen to those you have written off as a lost cause.
Title: Ask Different Questions Content: Ask unusual questions when seeking for new answers, else you get the usual answers.Push yourself to think what’s surprising, what you are ignoring and what you thing might be of use. Different questions open you up to new possibilities and create a more flexible, agile mind-set.
