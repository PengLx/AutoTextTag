Title: The weirdness of it Content: Reaching out privately to a colleague can feel weird because making the active decision to initiate a conversation usually creates the expectation that you want something.So explain why you're reaching out. Always give a reason why you want to talk to someone. Also, send one message, then wait for a response. And if someone continually doesn't respond when you reach out, take the hint.
Title: Conversation starters: Reach out Content: Reaching out and offering your help to a new colleague, for example, is a great way to start a conversation.It can feel weird, but in a remote setup, this is the only way these chats will happen.
Title: Conversation starters: Respond privately Content: A great way to start a conversation with a teammate is to respond privately to comments made in public channels.For example:Your comment was very funny!Great job on solving that tricky issue!Thank you for answering my question, I appreciate your perspective.
Title: Conversation starters: Be vulnerable Content: Explain that you just want to say hello.This is usually enough to remove the weirdness of just saying "hi," especially if you frame it using a little humor.
Title: Don't mind the delays  Content: Sometimes people will respond immediately. But sometimes they won't, and that's okay.Everyone has things to do, and that means they will not be responding to every message right away. 
Title: Respect people's status Content: A status is a good way to let people know that you're doing focused work or that you're otherwise unable to respond.Don't reach out to chat when someone is busy.
