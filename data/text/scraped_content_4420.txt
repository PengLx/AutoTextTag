Title: Drawing is a Natural Process Content: For centuries, schools have established the normal, natural process of drawing as an art, like painting. Drawing as a creative process is forgotten and distorted beyond recognition.People see it as a professional skill, whereas it is about freedom, creativity and a way to observe and learn about the world around us.Drawing is about the process, without any need of 'performing' or receiving any evaluation.
Title: Drawing as a Tool Content: Drawing is a problem-solving visual tool. It helps us think better and provides clarity to a cluttered mind.Authentic pen and paper drawing help us break free from the limiting domains of technology which digital tools like Google image search or drawing software provide, indirectly hindering our creativity.Drawing also makes us slow down, observe and pay attention.Drawing promotes close observation, analytical thinking, patience, and even humility, making it one of the best ways to learn.
