Title: A Good 24-hour Hackathon Content: Centers on the customer process or journey and supports a clear business target.Involves employees from all relevant areas to find different ways of working a problem.Challenge participants to reimagine an existing method to try to find the most efficient way to improve the customer experience.Sessions start with ideas but end with a working prototype. Output includes a clear development path that highlights all the steps needed to accelerate production and implementation. The hackathon concludes with a presentation to senior leaders, including a real-life demonstration of the new prototype and a roadmap of IT and other capabilities needed to bring the final version to market.Once the teams agree on what to do, those responsible for execution create a virtual model that the group vets, refines and re-releases in continual cycles until the new process or app meets the desired experience criteria. Management prevents the dissipation of enthusiasm and energy created on the hackathon by placing new processes to sustain it.
