Title: Arrival Of Children Content: The general consensus amongst social scientists is that children cause a drop in marital and relationship satisfaction.Moreover, marital satisfaction usually doesn't begin to recover until children "leave the nest". Raising kids is certainly worthwhile, but that doesn't change the fact that it's immensely difficult even with careful planning.
Title: Living Together Before Marriage Content: A couple should probably make sure they can successfully cohabitate before deciding to spend the rest of their lives together. However, there's no scientific evidence that premarital cohabitation improves marriage quality or reduces divorce rates.
Title: Attraction BetweenOpposites  Content: There's no evidence that differences lead to greater attraction or improved relationship outcomes. Similarity does predict attraction and relationship success.
Title: The Libido Of Men And Women Content: Research indicates that measured physiological signs of arousal are self-reported more accurately in men than in women. Also, straight and lesbian women show physiological signs of arousal when watching sexual videos regardless of who was with whom.The gap between the arousal that women report and the arousal they feel, is theorized to be a consequence of societal repression.
