Title: The Worst Ways To Sleep Content: Sleeping on the sides, which is how most people sleep, can aggravate heartburn and acidity, especially for those who sleep on their right side.Stomach sleepers are doing a lot of harm to the entirety of their body, from the stomach to the neck/shoulder.
Title: Back Sleeping Content: This is the best option and makes your body rejuvenate in the most natural way. Taking a slim pillow under your head helps and itâ€™s best to keep your head at the same level as your body.The only problem is, this position can worsen the sleep apnea.
Title: Keep The Same Position While Sleeping Content: Try to sleep on your back by training yourself to not shift positions, either by keeping pillows on both sides of your body, or to place an object inside your shirt that makes it uncomfortable to go to your default position (which can happen involuntarily).Most of our body pain and other discomforts can be removed or drastically reduced by sleeping on our back.
