Title: Serendipity and being open to the unexpected Content: Serendipity is making unexpected discoveries. It is not entirely controllable nor predictable. It means seeing solutions where others find none.In a rapidly changing world, we don't know which problems to solve or which resources to develop. To meet this challenge, we must learn to accept the limitations of planning and welcome the potential of the unexpected.
Title: Develop the conditions for serendipity Content: Several companies design flexible structures and processes to cope with the unexpected. Uncertainty presents not only a challenge but also a potential opportunity.The company, Haier, developed a 'platform ecosystem' where employees can present their ideas to an investment committee.They also developed a digital ecosystem around users where the user is the core. A culture of innovation is encouraged by rewarding autonomous decision-making and encouraging employee teams to find external partners to develop ideas.Other companies focus on coffee trials, where you are randomly paired up with other employees over lunch.
