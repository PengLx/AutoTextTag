Title: System Content: The best part is that the system or the matrix, as a conscious entity, doesn’t want to keep us trapped, even if that is all we have known and believed for most of our lives. This may be the most difficult thing to digest. Because many people’s identities are centered around the fact that evil is outside. That we are in a war with evil forces and we must free ourselves. The system wants us free so that it doesn’t have to keep bearing the unbearable burden of these ridiculous projections.
