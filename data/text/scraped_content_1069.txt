Title: Inspiring leaders Content: The leaders that inspire are those who use a personal combination of strengths to motivate individuals and teams to take on bold missions and to hold them accountable for results.And they unlock higher performance through empowerment, not thorough command and control.
Title: Becoming an Inspiring Leader Content: You only need centeredness: a state of mindfulness that enables leaders to remain calm under stress, empathize, listen deeply, and remain present. Your key strength has to match how your organization creates value.You have to behave differently if you want your employees to do so.
