Title: Attention Management: Individuals Vs Teams Content: Individuals can manage their attention by optimizing their to-do list and doing focus work with the help of curated tasks and flow-friendly work environments, and by not multitasking.Teams have a more challenging time managing their attention as one has to take into account the inter-relatedness and interdependency of the group while having less agility. Example: In order for an entire team to deliver on a deadline, they would need to say no to requests from other teams for work that will distract from the main project.

The Eisenhower Matrix can be used to diagrammatically list the urgency and importance of all the work on the plate.Let the team have time and space to complete the actionable tasks, being free to be in the no-disturbance flow mode for several hours a day.Chat and email notifications can be checked in separate blocks of time and a phone call can be only for emergencies.
