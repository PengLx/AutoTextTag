Title: Too Much Of A Good Thing Content: Good and effective things are helpful at one level but when taken too far, can be destructive.In 1946, Sir Alexander Fleming, a renowned microbiologist, stated that antibiotics (like penicillin) were so effective that it will be abused by the masses, resulting in bacteria mutating and becoming drug-resistant. His prophecy came true, and this new, mutated bacteria is a reality.
Title: Taking The Opposite View Content: In the field of investing, Contrarians take the opposite view, akin to cynicism, and think of the collective mainstream view as a kind of mass delusion. Occasionally, a contrary view is welcome, but if it is done every time, then the good times when one has to simply ride the wave are missed, leading to bitterness.
Title: Balancing Optimism Content: A positive attitude has the power to change our thinking and facilitate good things in our lives. Optimism surely beats pessimism as a worldview, when one has to pick a side.Too much optimism turns into a delusion and eventually complacency. One starts getting out of touch with reality and lives in the mode of denial.
Title: Being Open-Minded Content: As truth is complicated in this day and age, being open-minded takes us out of the bubble we develop around us, based out of our good and bad life experiences.Being too open-minded robs us of our basic checks and balances, making us get lost in a rabbit hole full of contradictions.One has to take a firm stand on their views to make concrete decisions.
