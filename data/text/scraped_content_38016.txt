Title: Gone :( Content: I can’t believe I just typed those words.Kobe Bryant is gone.I suspect this is one of those moments we’ll all remember where we were when we first heard the news. Magic Johnson’s HIV announcement comes to mind. MJ’s (first) shock retirement. The Tiger car accident. Princess Di. Michael Jackson. For older generations, JFK.And now, somehow, Kobe.
