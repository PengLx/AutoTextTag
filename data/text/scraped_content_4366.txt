Title: Fear of Failure Content: People are considered sub-par or 'not up to the mark' if they are not good at the preset measurements and examinations, which are designed by others, that have a risk-averse outlook towards life.To find true success in life, you have to be taught a healthy appreciation of failure, and freedom to create your path, free from preset guidelines or rules.
Title: Being Average Content: Being average should not be looked down upon. There are a lot of successful people, who are good at what they do and are average at best.Being consistent and reliable is more important than being exceptional.We should know our strengths and weaknesses, and move smartly towards success.
