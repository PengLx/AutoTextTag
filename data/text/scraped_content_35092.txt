Title: Brain Power Varies Content: The most important thing to understand here is...our brainpower, our cognitive abilities do not remain static over the course of a day...﻿We typically move through the day in three stage: peak, trough, recovery. Peak early in the day, trough in the middle of the day, early to mid-afternoon, recovery, late afternoon [to] early evening. What we know is this: during the peak, which for 80 percent of us is early in the day (not for owls—we’ll get to that in a moment). For 80 percent of us during that peak period, that’s when we are most vigilant. Vigilance means we’re able to bat away distractions. So what the research shows very clearly is that during that peak period, we should be doing our analytic work. Analytic work is simply work that requires heads-down focus and attention.
