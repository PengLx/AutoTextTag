Title: A Low Success Rate Content: New Year Resolutions typically show a low success rate, as 10% of them actually succeed.The reason for this low rate might be our basic instincts and temptations:people give into temptations that conflict with their long-term goals about one out of every five times they try to resist - a figure that rises rapidly if they're tired, busy or stressed.
Title: Willpower Content: If we strive to succeed it usually requires hard work.And hard work to achieve your desired goals requires willpower.Willpower, while important, isn't the only thing required for success.
Title: Emotions Content: Our emotions motivate us more than willpower. If we are generous, fair and co-operative, we have an invaluable tool to motivate us to complete our goals. If we cultivate good character, compassion, and honesty, it leads to a better chance of success in our endeavors.
