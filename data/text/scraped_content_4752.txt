Title: The People Comfort Zone Content: We normally interact and hang out with people whom we are comfortable with. They inhabit our 'Safe Harbor of the Known'.Outside our comfort zone, there will be people who inspire, intrigue us, and annoy us.When you jump out of our comfort zone to be with people who challenge, push, and even irritate us, then we grow and reach our fullest potential.
