Title: The "kindness pandemic" Content: Viruses aren’t the only things that spread through networks of people. Attitudes and behaviors do too. And we should take advantage of it.Spreading happiness and kindness right now is not going to magically kill the virus. But we need to stay optimistic and hopeful for the future.
Title: Spreading connection Content: 70% of our happiness comes from your relationships with other people. And the social distancing situation has left some with zero people around them.So reach out. Extended time without social contact is bad: Send a text, make that phone/video call, anything you want to let people know you care and are thinking about them.
Title: Spreading help Content: Ask people if they need anything. There are people out there in need of a little more than well wishes right now.And when people see others helping, they’re more likely to help.Also, if you need help, don’t be afraid to ask for it.
Title: Spreading gratitude Content: Sending a thank you message is a great way to make two people happy and spread positivity. Feeling gratitude means you are less likely to be depressed, anxious, lonely, envious, or neurotic.Also, don’t forget to show gratitude to the people you might be quarantined with.
Title: Spreading optimism Content: We need to be careful with optimism so that we don’t neglect serious concerns. Ifyou’re having serious illness symptoms, don’t be optimistic that they’ll clear up on their own and avoid medical care.But if the cost of being wrong is just a minor feeling of disappointment that things didn’t go your way, right now it’s better to stay positive.
