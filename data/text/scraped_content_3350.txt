Title: “Life-Extending” Time Content: Proactively invest your time in your health by eating well, exercising regularly, getting plenty of sleep, and regularly seeing your doctors. Make sure you also invest in the other markers of well-being: emotional, mental, and spiritual health.
Title: “Foundation-Building” Time Content: If you’re spending more time putting out fires than building the right foundations, you’ll never get out ahead of your to-do list.Spend time building relationships, identifying opportunities, time for prevention and planning.
Title: “Do-Nothing” Time Content: Investing in do-nothing time will help us slow down and experience a different pace of life, in which time’s value is not measured by its productivity.
Title: “System-Creating” Time Content: Investing some up-front time in creating better, more organized systems will reap you lots of time in the long run.For example, put a key hook by the door so that you don’t spend five minutes every morning hunting for your keys.
Title: “Cushion” Time Content: Building in lots of cushion time in your schedule and preventing being always in a hurry is a great investment in yourself and in the quality of life of those around you.Because being in a rush may be preventing you from being the kind of person you want to be—the kind to stop and help someone in need.
Title: “Savoring” Time Content: It requires slowing down and taking time to really look at the colors of the leaves, or eating slowly to enjoy the texture of a bite.Investing time in savoring all the unique sensorial moments of your day will guarantee your moments don’t flash by in a dull blur.
Title: “Time Assessment” Time Content: Take time to evaluate how you invest your time. A good system could include:15 minutes/week to review your past week’s schedule.One hour/month of quiet time with a journal to assess the past season.One day/year of time alone or with a friend or partner assessing the past year.
