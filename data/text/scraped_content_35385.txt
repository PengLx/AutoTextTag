Title: Decision Paralysis Content: Based on the concept of Decision Paralysis, if you give users twenty amazing features at the beginning, they feel flustered and don't use a single one. But if you give them only two or three of those features, and have them slowly unlock more, then they begin to enjoy and love the complexity.  
Title: Evolved UI Content: Evolved UI concept is very difficult for a company to implement emotionally, because it feels weird to withhold great features and functionalities from the user. For the designer though, it is important to acknowledge that withholding options can drive more behavior towards the Desired Action. Just because it makes users feel uncomfortable doesn't mean it's necessarily bad for you, nor for the user. 
Title: Sony's Take Content: One company that did implement the Evolved UI concept was Sony, calling it Evolution U/175. Though the Android smartphone system developed by Google was very powerful, Sony realized that it had a high learning curve that could fluster beginning users. To address the situation, they launched the Evolution UI, which presented a very limited set of core options during the Onboarding process.
