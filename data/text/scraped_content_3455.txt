Title: Traditional vs Lateral Thinking Content: Traditional thinking: is vertical and the process flows in a logical manner toward a conclusion, based on available information.Lateral thinking: is horizontal and the process is centered ongenerating many ideas while de-emphasizing the details of how those ideas could be implemented.These 2 ways of thinking are complementary.
Title: 2 Stages of Thinking Content: The perceived stage, where the brain focuses on identifying a certain pattern (a way in which the brain frames the environment).The second stage uses that pattern and builds upon it to reach a conclusion.But to get better at identifying patterns and prevent errors in the first stage, we need to develop our lateral thinking.
Title: Learning to Think Laterally Content: Be aware of how your brain processes information and how it identifies patterns.Don't shut out all the outside stimuli and allow some form of randomness into your day. This could expose you to new insights.Consider alternative approaches and solutions to problems, even if you think you found the apparently suitable one.Deliberately alternate available options (do the opposite of an implied direction, reverse processes, etc.) This could expose you to new insights and tools to create solutions with.
