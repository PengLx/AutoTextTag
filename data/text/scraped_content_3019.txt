Title: Consistency and perfection Content: We make the mistake of believing that sticking to good habits is an all-or-nothing game. For example: we assume that if we slip up on our diet, then we have ruined the whole thing.These beliefs are incorrect, becauseconsistency does not require perfection.
Title: The second mistake Content: When it comes to building good habits and breaking bad habits, individual mistakes don't matter in the long-run;it's the second mistake that is far more important.One mistake is just an outlier. Two mistakes represent the beginning of a pattern.
Title: How to get back on track Content: Put all of your energy toward starting the positive desired behavior.Take motivation out of the equation and set a schedule for your behavior. Eliminate the things that take you off track. Some emergencies canâ€™t be avoided, but there are many daily distractions that can be eliminated.
