Title: Choose your field of activity wisely Content: Nowadays people are mostly driven by the idea of making a lot of money in as short of time as possible. However, one thing everybody should take into account is that unless you are really into a certain field, you are bound to give up quite easily as soon as things get just a bit more challenging. Therefore, when choosing your field of activity, think both at how much you really like what this implies and how much money it will bring.
Title: The key to success Content: There is no such thing as the key to success. However, being ambitious, lucky and persistent can really work. While nothing guarantees success, finding what you like and trying to become good at it are definitely important steps in that direction.
Title: Focus on your own goals Content: There is a certain temptation we all feel when it comes to other people's success: check out exactly how they made it u to this level. Nevertheless, this is not really the appropriate approach, as each individual has its own path in life: so better focus on your goal and how you plan to achieve it.
