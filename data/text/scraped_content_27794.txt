Title: Shopping Addiction Content: Compulsive shopping is when chronic, repetitive buying habits have serious consequences and become a disorder, similar to drug addiction. Conscious spending is one of ways we can overcome this emotional need to buy stuff.An inability to handle money effectively and lack of impulse control makes us spend like crazy. Our emotions take over and we feel comfort in spending, and we unconsciously spend on stuff we donâ€™t need, creating a vicious circle of debt followed by further compulsive spending.
Title: Overspenders Content: People do not even know that they are addicted to shopping and are unable to understand the problem. Their confused relationship with money is looked upon by them as a symptom of the other problems of their lives. Many victims feel lost and are unable to control themselves out of the addiction consciously.
