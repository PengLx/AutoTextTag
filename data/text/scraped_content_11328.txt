Title: Precrastination Content: In our quest to beat procrastination, is it possible to go too far. Precrastination is a tendency to rush too quickly into the pending tasks, and can be a wasteful mental effort towards what might have been a stress-free task, if a bit of planning was applied.Example: A person who is precrastinating would hurriedly read and respond to all emails lying in the inbox, depleting precious energy on pseudo-work, energy that could have been used at something more important.
Title: Reasons for Precrastination Content: The work in front of us seems urgent, even though it may not be important, and we are instinctively wired to complete it. If something is immediately available to us, we instinctively go for it. Short-term tasks that seemingly would take five minutes to complete are done first. We also have an eagerness to please and conscientiousness (our desire to do our duties thoroughly) that make us precrastinators.
Title: Don't Do Everything Content: Chronic Precrastinators must understand that it is ok to ‘not’ do trivial things right away and to use that mental energy and willpower to work on something substantial and important.In today’s world, it should be okay to slow down, to be deliberate and mindful.
