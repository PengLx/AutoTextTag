Title: Being Smart Is Not Enough Content: Most companies hire the smartest people they can find, as they look for candidates who can provide innovative ideas, do the best kind of ‘coding’ or make a great presentation/report.What hiring managers overlook and often ignore are the predominantly social people who ‘talk’ a lot, and are always on social media, assuming them to be a useless, unproductive lot.
Title: The Geniuses and The Social Butterflies Content: Geniuses: An organization filled with genius-level workforce won’t have people learning from each other, turning into an anti-social organization full of isolated, lonely performers.Butterflies: Socially adept workers pollinate good ideas and spread innovation around, even ideas that may not be concrete, brilliant or easily visible. This makes the butterflies an essential part of the pollination of information in the organization, creating a healthier, more productive environment.
