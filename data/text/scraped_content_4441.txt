Title: Uhh... Umm... Content: The 'Uhs' and 'Ums' we naturally utter while speaking, or giving a speech, are generally considered to be a flaw, and a person who makes a lot of these pauses while giving a speech is generally considered weak, nervous, ignorant or sloppy.But these pauses in natural human speech, called disfluencies, may not be a character flaw, but an organic feature of human speech, which is enhancing the listeners' understanding and comprehension.
Title: Our Brain's Spinning Noise Content: Disfluencies occur naturally when a speaker is processing thought while speaking a sentence, talking and thinking at the same time. The speaker can take slightly longer to find the correct phrase or word and says 'uhh'. This can also drum up the next words, making the listeners remember them.
Title: Natural Sounding Artificial Intelligence Content: The attempt to remove disfluencies from public speaking is in effect 'robotizing' human beings, who unconsciously display their wisdom, intellect, and complex thinking by naturally using the pauses in their speeches.Ironically, synthesized voice systems and Artificial Intelligence assistants are now beginning to insert disfluencies in their artificial speech, to sound warm and human-like to the listener.
