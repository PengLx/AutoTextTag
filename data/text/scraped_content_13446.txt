Title: Barriers to reaching out Content: Even in times of isolation, you can do more good than you may think by reaching out to others. And before that, you have to get over the impulse to underestimate how positively others will respond to your action. We fear how the other person will respond. We think, Will this be awkward? Will they want to talk to me? But these concerns are exaggerated and they build a misplaced psychological barrier to reaching out to others.
Title: Shrinking the physical distance Content: Technology helps us to still be very close to others socially, as long as we use it to shrink our distance from others.Engage in more deep and intimate conversation, or connect through a more intimate medium that uses your voice rather than text.
Title: Underestimating the response of other people Content: Underestimating how others will respond to us reaching out does not end with more meaningful conversations; it extends to almost any action we perform to reach out and connect positively with others: expressing gratitude to another person, writing compliments, performing random acts of kindness, etc.
