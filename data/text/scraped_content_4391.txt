Title: The Question of Free Will Content: The centuries-old question about human beings having free will or not is still unanswered but is fundamental for our moral codes, justice systems, religion and even the very meaning of life.The argument about having predetermined choices amounting to not having free will does not hold upon careful reflection.Our definition of free will, and the existence of fate, is crucial for our understanding of whether life has any point at all.
Title: Randomness and Determined Choice Content: Randomness is when things have no pattern in them. Our free-willed choices cannot be random as the process of randomness can produce any pattern whatsoever, by mere chance.As determined or predetermined choices are by default not in free will, it is concluded that free will can neither be random nor determined.
Title: Phenomenality Content: Our entire life is a stream of felt and perceived phenomenality. This is the content of consciousness, something that fills all metaphysics and materialism.We feel all our emotional states like fears, desires, inclinations, and these states are not merely neurons firing in our brains, at least how we experience them, known as 'felt volitional states'.
Title: The World is an Illusion Content: According to the 19th-century philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, the physical world is just an image, a perceptual representation of the world in the mind of the observer, and it is not how the world actually is.
