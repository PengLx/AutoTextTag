Personal Development,Psychology,Motivation & Inspiration
Title: Comparing ourselves to others Content: It allows them to drive our behavior. Sometimes it’s about something genetic/physical (wishing to be taller for example), but more often it’s about something the other person is capable of doing that we wish we could do as well.Sometimes this comparison is motivating and sometimes it’s destructive.
Title: You can be anything Content: ... but you can’t be everything.When we compare ourselves to others, we’re often comparing their best features against our average ones.It’s like being right-handed and trying to play an instrument with your left hand.
Title: Recipe for unhappiness Content: Not only are we unhappy but the other people are as well.  They are probably comparing themselves to you.At worst, when we compare ourselves to others we end up focusing our energy on bringing them down instead of raising ourselves up.
Title: The only game you'll win Content: There is one thing that you’re better at than other people: being you. This is the only game you can really win.Life becomes about being a better version of yourself. And your effort and energy go toward upgrading your personal operating system every day, not worrying about what your coworkers are doing, for example.
