Title: The challenge Content: In 1960, Theo Geisel, known as Dr. Seuss, was challenged to write an entertaining children's book using only 50 different words. The result was the best-selling book,Green Eggs and Ham. It sold over 200 million copies.
Title: The Power of Constraints Content: Dr. Seuss discovered while writing his book "Green Eggs and Ham" the power of setting constraints.Setting limits for yourself (time, money, words, etc.) often leads to better results than if you keep your options open.
Title: Constraints have benefits Content: Limitations inspire you to find creative solutions. If you have a one-year-old child that requires all your time, you have to find creative ways to get some exercise.Constraints force you to get something done. Without constraints, we would postpone our tasks, sometimes indefinitely. That is why professionals set a schedule for their production while amateurs wait for the perfect moment.
Title: Constraints are Not the Enemy Content: We often complain about our limitations. "I don't have enough time." or "I don't have enough money." Every artist has a limited set of tools to create with. Every entrepreneur has limited resources to work with.Constraints don't hamper you. Once you know your constraints, you can find out how to work with them.
Title: Your limitations Content: You only have half an hour to exercise? That is your limitation. Put those 30 minutes to proper use.Can you only spare 15 minutes each day to write?  That is the size of your constraint. Your job is to make it a work of art.You only have $100 to start your business? Great! Make each sales call work for you.We can complain about our limits or use them. How you use that constraint is up to you.
