Title: Impostor Syndrome Content: It is a psychological phenomenon that reflects the belief that you’re an inadequate and incompetent failure despite evidence that indicates you’re skilled and quite successful.
Title: The Perfectionist Content: They set the barexcessively high for themselves and when they fail to reach their goals, they experience major self-doubt.For this type, success is rarely satisfying because they believe they could’ve done even better.But that’s not productive. Learning to celebrate achievements is essential if you want to avoid burnout and find contentment.
Title: The Superwoman/man Content: Impostor workaholics are actually addicted to the validation that comes from working, not to the work itself. They push themselves to work harder, to measure up with their colleagues.Start drifting away from external validation.No one should have more power to make you feel good about yourself than you.
Title: The Natural Genius Content: They judge their competences based on ease and speed as opposed to their efforts. If they take a long time to master something, they feel shame.To move past this, try seeing yourself as a work in progress:identify specific, changeable behaviors that you can improve over time.
Title: The Soloist Content: Soloists feel as though asking for help will reveal that they're a fraud.It’s OK to be independent, but not to the extent that you refuse assistance so that you can prove your worth.
Title: The Expert Content: Experts measure their competence based on “how much” they know or can do.Believing they will never know enough, they fear being exposed as inexperienced or unknowledgeable.Start practicing just-in-time learning. This means acquiring a skill when you need it–for example if your responsibilities change–rather than hoarding knowledge for (false) comfort.
