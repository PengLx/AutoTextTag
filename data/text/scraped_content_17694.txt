Title: A very rational approach to life Content: Today's world has comfortably dispensed with most myth and superstition for the last few hundred years.That's the Enlightenment legacy: we have approached a very rational approach to life. This has brought us many great things, but it has also left us with a sort of meaning gap.
Title: The need for meaning Content: Our need for meaning around the concept of death is still very present.So it's no wonder that psychics and spiritual mediums have come in with a their version of meaning: even if they don't really offer useful, they give this impression anyway.
Title: Why we resort to magic Content: Psychics and mediums have become very popular because we are desperate for some sort of narrative that gives us a sense of something bigger.We know they sometimes are theatrical, but they tap into our need for that feeling of wonder, of transcendence.
Title: Finding meaning in life Content: You only find meaning in life by finding a thing that's bigger than you and immersing yourself in that thing.And meaning is more important than happiness.
