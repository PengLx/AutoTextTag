Title: Being present in conversations Content: Get your face out of your phone and focus your attention.Be willing to receive information.Be willing to engage in the conversation and to listen with the intent to understand.Be willing to stay the course and not let your mind wander.Bring the conversation to a close with takeaways and next steps.Respect the existence of emotions and their roles and be aware of the body language also.Keep your ego out of the conversation.
Title: What happens when you listen Content: Listening is the basis for growth and advancement.You can’t advance your skills and knowledge without understanding others.Listening is also important because we all want love and respect; we want to spend time with people who listen.
