Title: Do a reality check Content: Being happy is a matter of choice, they say. And so it is most often. In order to make sure you make the most of your time, you should always bear in mind that life can be as beautiful as it can be hard.Being aware of the reality you live in enables you to better achieve your goals as well as to better face any difficulties that might turn up at some point during your life.
Title: Point out  your problem Content: When feeling unhappy, make sure you understand very well what the issue is. Without a clear identification of the problem, there can be no permanent solution.This applies especially when you think the issue is yourself: after some good years, you are still not the person you have always wanted to be. And that is perfectly fine: embrace your defaults as well as your qualities and learn to work on them for further improvement.
Title: Acceptance and hustling Content: If you have recently come to the conclusion that you are not happy, you might want to considerate two aspects: firstly, it is worth working hard in order to achieve your goals and secondly, sometimes you have to accept that you can not have everything, as you do not possess the ability to change the world. Try it for a change and you might just feel a bit happier afterwards.
