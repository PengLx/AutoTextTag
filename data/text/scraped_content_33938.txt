Title: A Common Pitfall in a Connected World Content: Our world today is more connected than ever. And one pitfall in our hyper-connected world as it intersects with our business relationships and networking is a state of continuous partial attention. It is a state where people give half attention to what they do - all the time.
Title: Face-to-Face Networking and Social Media Content: When attending a function of any type, it is increasingly common to find people paying attention to their mobile devices instead of effectively connecting with others.While our desire to connect and be connected is a strength, we can lose the connection with the person in front of us when we simultaneously pay attention to our phone. 
Title: Working While Distracted Content: Most of us work at our computers with notifications switched on: email, social media and different streaming services.It is very easy to lose track of what you were last doing. Continuous partial attention keeps you from being alert, attentive, and focused. Social media is great to stay in touch, but we need to know when to focus on face-to-face interactions and put notifications on Do Not Disturb.
