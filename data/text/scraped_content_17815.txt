Title: Failure Content: Success is sought after by most, while failure is looked down upon, even seen as something shameful.More than success, it is our failures, errors and rejections that provide us with better learnings, and pathways towards eventual success, if we study them.
Title: The Ostrich Effect Content: Once we have invested our time, effort and resources in something, we tend to avoid correcting ourselves in real-time if we are off-track.Inversely, when people engage in mental contrasting, anticipating the upcoming obstacles, they tend to succeed.
Title: Failure Is A Goldmine Content: Sharing information on failure among peers means less work overall, and better success for the entire team, as team members do not have to reinvent the wheel by making the same mistake to learn from it.People do not share failure as it hurts their self-esteem, but if we keep the personal equation aside, a lot can be gained from the collective knowledge of what didnâ€™t work.
Title: Screw-Up Nights Content: Some young organizations have started the trend of sharing failure among their teams and even the entire organization. These are great opportunities for employees to talk about their mistakes and admit when they were wrong, while the rest benefit from the lessons learned.
