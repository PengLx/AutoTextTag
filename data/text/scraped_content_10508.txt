Title: The lows and highs of chemistry Content: Feeling chemistry with someone can lead not only to successful relationships, but also to major traumatic experiences. Not being able to put your needs first, while accepting their drawbacks, only because you are immensely attracted to that person, can actually break your spirit. 
Title: Choosing right your partner Content: According to dating experts, what makes the difference between a successful and an unsuccessful relationship is the trust, intimacy and, most especially, the willingness of each partner to meet the other one's needs. Therefore, next time you feel attracted to someone, try to also observe their reactions whenever you express your feelings or needs. This will be a major indicator of the success of your relationship.
Title: Choosing caring over chemistry in a relationship Content: Whenever you find yourself in the situation of falling in love with someone new, you might as well want to pay attention to more than the person's looks or financial situation. Identify your non-negotiables in terms of 'must be' for your future relationship and do not give them up. If they are not negotiable, then you are most certainly not going to be happy in their absence.
