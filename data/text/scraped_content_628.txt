Title: Environment shapes human behavior Content: To be successful, you need to act in an environment that favors your results rather than blocking them.Motivation, talent, and effort do have matter, but your personal characteristics tend to get overpowered by your environment.
Title: Automate good decisions Content: Design an environment that makes good decisions for you.For example, buying smaller plates can help you lose weight by deciding portion size for you. Similarly, using software to block social media sites can help overcome procrastination by putting your willpower on autopilot.
Title: Getting in the flow of good habits Content: For example: you are more likely to go to the gym if it is literally on the way home from work than if the gym is only five minutes away, but in the opposite direction of your commute.
Title:  Content: You can also reduce the negative influences in your environment.For example: you can make it easier to avoid unhealthy foods by storing them in less visible places.
