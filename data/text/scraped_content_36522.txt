Title: Behaviors of highly engaged employees Content: They do not use their problems as an excuse from mistakes. They don't let the problem affect their ability to perform.They know how to take accountability for their actions.They are independent and are proactive in learning how to solve problems on their own until a collaboration is needed.They explore different methods on how they can do their best work and focus on their strengths, not their weaknesses.
Title: The management and highly-engaged employees Content: Managers create the conditions that promote the behaviors of engaged employees with the relationships they establish.The bosses who individualize create a space for their employees to seek out their strengths and only ask when advice is needed.The bosses who generalize will often require constant managerial intervention because they don't foster engagement-creating behavior.
Title: Engagement-oriented questions Content: Asking engagement oriented questions allows the employee to be able to think for themselves and to examine situations, analyze their own performance and generate great ideas or solutions.This method is modeled from the Socratic Method that aids in stimulating mindful observation and critical thinking.For example: "This report has been on your desk for a while now. Are you having trouble getting the information you need to complete it? Do you need help?"
