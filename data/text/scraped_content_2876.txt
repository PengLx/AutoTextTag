Title: The meaning of 'genius' Content: This is one of the most misused terms in history.We correctly label intellectual brilliance and creative power as 'genius'  but we should stop assuming that those things arise from talent or inborn giftedness alone.While talent is indeed responsible for some extraordinary results, most accomplishments generally result from a combination of practice, habit, and mindset.
Title: Reflect for 10 minutes a day Content: Ask yourself one hard question every day, and take time to ponder it. How often do you ask yourself why you do what you do?Deep, contemplative questions force you to go further than most people ever do when they're daydreaming or casually dosing off, and they teach you to think with clarity.
Title: Read for 20 minutes a day Content: An article may engage you, and you may even learn something new and valuable,  but it can't quite do the job of absorbing you like a good story or some detailed research might.If you were to read 15 pages of a book per day, by the end of the year, you'd have completed between 15 to 20 books.That's a greater return on time and money invested than any other activity.
Title: Focus for 30 minutes a day Content: Learning to learn is a crucial quality for this fast-changing world, and it comes from the ability to focus on something that pushes you to ask more of yourself.It doesn't matter if it's a hobby or a personal project, it's worth dedicating even just half an hour a day to getting a little better at it in a tangible and measurable way.
