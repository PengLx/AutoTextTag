Title: Position of products influences our decision of buying Content: We don't just buy products because of what they are, but we often buy them because of where they are. For example, items on store shelves that are at eye level tend to be purchased more than items on less visible shelves.
Title:  Content: Optimize for defaults -Shift your environment so that the good behaviors are easier and the bad behaviors are harder.
Title: Default decisions and their influence Content: Although we usually have the freedom to make a wide range of choices at any given moment, we often make decisions based on the environment we find ourselves in:If you sleep with your phone next to your bed, then checking social media and email as soon as you wake up is likely to be the default decision.If you keep a water bottle with you throughout the day, then drinking water rather than soda is more likely to be the default decision.
Title: Designed for you vs. designed by you Content: Default choices are not inherently bad, but the entire world was not designed with your goals in mind. In fact, many companies have goals that directly compete with yours (a food company may want you to buy their bag of chips, while you want to lose weight). For this reason, you should be wary of accepting every default as if it is supposed to be the optimal choice. - James Clear
