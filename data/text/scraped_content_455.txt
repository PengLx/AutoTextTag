Title: Avoid the "all or nothing" mindset Content: Exercise doesn't have to be complicated. Doing something is better than doing nothing. Don't let optimal be the enemy of good enough. Do what you can do consistently and worry about optimizing later as you gain traction.
Title: Wellness is a personal science Content: Accept advice, but remember you're in this for youâ€”no one else, and you're the only one who'll know what really works. Having an abundance of options isn't a bad thing, but remember who you're in this for.
Title: Whatever you do, enjoy it Content: Choose something rewarding enough to make you feel good about doing it. If you're having a good time, mistakes feel like learning experiences and challenges to be overcome, not throw-up-your-hands-and-give-up moments.
Title: Use technology for your victories Content: Use it to see your progress in a way that looking in the mirror won't show you, whether it's on a calendar, in an app, or on a website. But remember, quantifying your efforts is just a method to track your progress. Your tech should be a means of building better habits, not the habit in itself.
