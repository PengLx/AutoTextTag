Title: Understanding mindfulness Content: One of the reasons mindfulness seems hard is the fact that you don't understand it. Mindfulness doesn't mean perfect focus and happiness at all times.Mindfulnessis about choosing to focus your attention on the present moment, about noticing when your mind wanders and bringing it back to what’s right in front of you.
Title: Be curious  Content: If you want to get better at practicing mindfulness, don't forget to be curious.Sometimes the details of daily life aren’t all that enjoyable. Traffic is boring, and your colleague at work is annoying. But what if we stop wishing reality was different and got curious about it? We might not miss our freeway exit. And we’d learn that our coworker is going through a messy divorce. Life would feel a little bit easier.
Title: Don't set unrealistic expectations Content: If you're struggling with mindfulness, maybe you’re making it bigger than it needs to be.You can notice a wandering mind in the shower or while you’re drinking your coffee. You can take a deep breath before you hit send or snap at your spouse.And you can remember that no matter how spacey, forgetful, impulsive, or reactive you’ve been, you can always begin again.
Title: Your mood matters Content: Don't practice being mindful only when you're upset.While mindfulness can certainly be helpful in difficult moments, our brains have a hard time learning or doing something new when they’re under stress. The more you practice paying attention to the present moment when you’re calm and happy, the easier and more effective it’ll be when you’re freaking out.
Title: Ask for support Content: Our brains are wired to think, worry, remember, predict, plan, and regret. Mindfulness asks us to swim against the tide of these mental habits.We need support in this practice, with books, lectures, classes, and conversations with like-minded friends.
