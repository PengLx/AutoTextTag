Title: Get to Know Your Audience Content: Presenting information is never about the presenter--it's always about the audience.Get to know who they are, in order to use their common knowledge and experience: What's most important to them? What motivates them? What's their background? How do they prefer to communicate? What "language" do they tend to use?
Title: The "One Thing" To Remember Content: To have a better chance of making complex information memorable, ask yourself these 2 questions:If my audience will only remember one thing about my explanation, what is that "one thing?"And, why should my audience care about this "one thing?"
Title: Give Context and Use Examples Content: The way you frame your information matters--the language, terms, and examples you choose to use will have a huge impact on what your audience remembers and understands.Paint a verbal picture. You will make theproblem tangible, and the solution appealing.
Title: Watch Your Language Content: While using long, technical words might seem impressive, it rarely helps anyone understand what's being said.Opt for using simple, everyday language. Along those same lines, avoid any acronyms, jargon, or highly-niche phrases. When it's impossible to avoid, make sure to define any complex terms.
