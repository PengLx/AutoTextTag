Title: The Ten Minute Philosophy of Success Content: If you do something daily and you are not getting the desired results, it simply means you are putting at least as much daily and sustainable effort against those results. If you exercise 10 minutes a daily, your fitness levels must improve, UNLESS you are also doing something which counters those efforts.If you believe, if you know that every sustained action brings results giving up is out of the question, any incentives for resignation disappear.
