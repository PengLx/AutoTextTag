Title: Complaining and venting Content: Social connection means sharing both positive and negative emotions. During a crisis, we can get comfort in sharing our fears and receive objective feedback.However, we have to consider if the end of a conversation results in feeling less worried or sad or are both parties emotionally exhausted and feeling worse.

We can do the same in turn for them.We learn we are not alone and may learn how others cope with their frustration and fear, which can help us adopt those methods.
