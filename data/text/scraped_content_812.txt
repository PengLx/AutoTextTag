Title: Get clear on your negotiation goals Content: There are 3 key questions you should ask yourself:What's the best possible outcome?What's your bottom line? This refers to the least acceptable offer. If you're the seller, what's the lowest offer you'd be willing to accept? And if you're the buyer, what's the most you'd be willing to pay?What's your plan B? Your "BATNA" - your best alternative to a negotiated agreement. What are you going to do if you don't reach an agreement?
Title: Determine your core negotiation strategy (CNS) Content: It means finding the doorway that you want to enter the negotiation through. That could be the doorway of safety and liability or of value, the doorway of competitionor of future business.
Title: Understand your negotiation signature Content: That signatureis the habitual way that you go about a negotiation.Understanding your default signature helps you know what you're working with. Some people try to go in and beat the other person up on price. Other people are really intimidated, reticent, and afraid to ask for anything.
Title: Build Motivation Content: One of the most powerful things you can do in a negotiation is draw out why the other party wants to make a deal. You can do this by asking questions and building negotiating roots.Asking questions about their competition and why they want to work with you -- what's in it for them -- builds your negotiating counterpart's motivation.
Title: Play the reluctant part Content: Use your body language to communicate your reluctance, to communicate you're not really eager to make a deal: sit back from the table and keep the tension in your bodies lowYou can manipulate your voice to sound more reluctant: speak slowly and softly.Reluctant parties qualify their language. They don't show excitement. Everything is qualified and subdued.
