Title: Hoarding: A Short-Term Buzz Content: We like to accumulate stuff as we believe it makes us (or others) happier, though it is just a short-term feeling. Most of us do not realize the fickleness and subjectivity of the value of the hoarded object. The flipside to this is that hoarders collect a lot of ‘junk’ and live with a lot of stuff they don’t really need. Real contentment and satisfaction don't come from collecting things, but from the time we spend with our loved ones, the great relationships we have, or even a new place that we visit.
Title: Do’s And Don’ts For Hoarders Content: Don’t beat around the bush for the real reason that an object is bought: It brings joy.Don’t think you can get rid of everything overnight, becoming a minimalist.Try to follow the ‘Use It Or Lose It’ philosophy. If you don’t lose what you don’t need, you end up losing your time, money, space, relationships and opportunities.
Title: Starting The Decluttering Process Content: Start clearing out your garage, closets and other spaces in instalments, like for 15 to 20 minutes per day, five days a week.Try not to be too serious, or you end up having a family feud due to the chaos or disagreements over what to keep and what to let go.Donate as much as you can.Only keep those old photographs which are of people you remember by name.
