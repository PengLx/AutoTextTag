Title: The Appeal to Force Content: This fallacy occurs when a person makes a threat of physical or psychological violence against others if they refuse to accept the conclusions offered. It can also happen when a person claims that accepting a conclusion or idea will lead to harm or disaster.Children are more prone to this fallacy when they say, "If you don't agree, I'll punish you!"
Title: An Examples of the Appeal to Force Content: Adults use the fallacy more subtly."If you don't support the spending bill to develop better airplanes, our enemies will think we are weak and will attack us at some point, killing millions." The person offering this argument is using psychological pressure to get agreement. There is no apparent connection between "our enemies" and the conclusion that it will be in the country's best interest.
