Title: Right-brained or left-brained Content: According to conventional wisdom, people tend to be either right-brained or left-brained. Those who are right-brained are supposed to be intuitive and creative free thinkers; they are big-picture thinkers. Left-brained people tend to be more quantitative and analytical. They pay attention to details and logic.Although these ideas are widespread, they may also be wrong.
Title: Location Content: Some brain functions reside more on one side of the brain than the other. The left side of the brain control language and the right half control movement of the left arm and leg (and vice versa.)But for more individual personality traits, such as creativity or a tendency toward the rational rather than the intuitive, there is little or no evidence supporting the claim that these reside in a specific area of the brain.
Title: The right-brain/left-brain myth Content: The idea of right-brain/left-brain may be a myth as evidence is mounting against the idea.A 2013 study demonstrated that activity is similar on both sides of the brain regardless of one's personality. The study concluded that the notion that some people are more left or right-brained is more a figure of speech than it is anatomically accurate.
