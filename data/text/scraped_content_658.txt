Title: Describe, don’t define Content: Good problem-solving starts with an accurate description of the situation. Not with a definition.If you start defining the problem (for e.g, calling it an “accounting problem” or a “marketing problem”) you define the range of solutions that you will consider. So, instead of defining the problem, describe the situation.
Title: For a solid description of a situation Content: Get the story of the problem - a timeline with its evolution.Make lists of what you know and what you need to investigate.Ask the journalist’s basic questions: who, what, when, where, and why.Refine your answers by comparing the situation you don’t like to one that’s acceptable.
Title: Optimal problem-solving meetings Content: Schedule them early, before people have used up their thinking and attention on less important things. Eliminate distractions: put laptops and phones on a table at the back.For serious problems, do more than one meeting. Do some work on the situation, then let things rest. Some people may have ideas the interim that may prove helpful.
