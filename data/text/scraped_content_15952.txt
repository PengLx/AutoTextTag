Title: Gestures: A Warning System Content: Gestures act as an early warning system for intent, emotion, and mood. Our body language precedes the desire of our conscious minds. Our bodies know what we want before our conscious minds do.So it's useful to watch others' body language to know what they're thinking, desiring, and feeling. In turn, we have to learn to listen to our unconscious mind. It's telling you that you're hungry, angry, bored, happy, and content.
Title: How to Use Your Intuition Content: If you've had the experience of a strong intuition about a person, or déjà vu, or a sensation in your gut that things are not right, even though on the surface it seems fine, then you've heard your unconscious mind trying to tell you something.Learn to regularly pay attention to your unconscious mind, not just in moments when something feels amiss. With practice, your ability to hear your unconscious quickly and accurately will improve.
