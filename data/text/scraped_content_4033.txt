Title: Language as a tool Content: When students are learning a foreign language, it is notable that some can express their thoughts beautifully with a limited vocabulary. Still, others that know the language much better struggle to make themselves understood.How well somebody communicates in a new language has very little to do with their language level and a lot more to do with their attitude.
Title: The struggle of learning a foreign language Content: Some people have a fear of being wrong. They measure success by how few mistakes they make.Some people know what the language should sound like, where they are at currently, and how far they have to go to get there.
Title: Where to put your focus Content: Speaking a language is not like those exams that many of us had to take in grade school, where a tiny grammar mistake would lose you marks.In the real world, small errors don't matter. What matters is to make yourself understood. Don't focus on yourself or on your own mistakes. Focus on the other person you're talking to and the result you want to get.
