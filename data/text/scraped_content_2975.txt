Title: Supplements and Metabolism Content: Myth: Supplements can speed up your metabolism.Over-the-counter products that claim to boost metabolism often don’t have calories, don’t directly impact your metabolism and have well documented potentially dangerous side effects and interactions with prescription drugs.Natural alternatives such as spicy foods do boost your metabolism, leading to more calories being burned, although not for long.
Title: Skinnier People Content: Myth: Skinnier people have faster metabolisms.It’s more about body composition than body size when it comes to metabolism. Metabolism depends on the composition of protein mass you have—muscle is more metabolically active, meaning the more muscle you have, the more calories you burn when you’re resting.This is why lifting weights is one of the best ways to speed up your metabolism, it adds muscles.
Title: Metabolism and Genetics Content: Myth: Metabolism is genetic, can't be changed.Your genes do influence your metabolism, but, unusual genetic conditions aside, lifestyle habits affect it more. The amount of exercise you get and the choices you make when you feed yourself are more important factors.
Title: Those With Fast Metabolism Content: Myth: Those with a fast metabolism can eat freely.People with faster metabolisms don’t necessarily put weight on as quickly as those with slower metabolisms. But a balanced diet comes with seriously consequential health benefits unrelated to weight maintenance, including good heart health and the prevention of certain cancers.
Title: Multiple Smaller Meals a Day Content: Myth: multiple smaller meals a day are better than 3 regular meals.Some research is coming out saying maybe it’s better to eat two or three modest meals a day. People often miscalculate the calories in the smaller meals resulting in a higher caloric intake than they would consume with three regular meals.
