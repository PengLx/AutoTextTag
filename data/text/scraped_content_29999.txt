Title: Being Unable To Articulate Your Thoughts Content: Many introverts face difficulty in being able to articulate what is in their minds into words.Introverts process information in a much deeper way, trying to think of the exact word, and this prolonged word-retrieval exercise makes them ‘freeze’.Introverts like to chew on ideas and are not vocal about their deep, inner thoughts.
Title: Long-Term Memory Vs Short-Term Memory For Introverts Content: Like in a computer hard disk, information that is retained for long periods of time is in our long-term memory and is not easy to recall reflexively, as it is outside our conscious awareness.Our short-term memory (also called working memory or active memory) is smaller in size and recalls information in an instant.Introverts seem to favour long-term memory over short-term memory.
Title: Writing And Introverts Content: Due to the way their brains are wired, introverts make great writers, able to express themselves in a more comfortable and relaxed manner, as they take their own time to build a great story or narrative.  Many introverts prefer text messages or email over phone calls, and are great at journaling and blogging.
Title: When The Mind Goes Blank Content: Stress, anxiety and any sort of pressure to divulge, recall or remember certain information can be a mental lock, interfering with memory.When your mind goes blank, one can try the following:Be calm and relaxed, practising quietness for a few moments.Buy yourself some time.Let your mind wander and naturally unlock your memory in a relaxed manner.Do not feel embarrassed and tell the person that you will get back to them by text or email, as you are engrossed in something else right now.
