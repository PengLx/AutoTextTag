Title: There are no productivity hacks Content: Habits and work systems can produce the best return on your time.Getting more work done is about knowing what to do, when to do it, and how to get it done in order to maximize the little time you have every day.
Title: Unimportant tasks are really just distractions Content: Urgent but unimportant tasks = distractions.Urgent tasks put us into constant “reply mode.” Important work is related to planned tasks that move us closer to our goals.
Title: Interruptions break your flow Content: Anytime you are pulled away from your tasks, it takes time to readjust to them when you jump back in (sometimes it can take up to 25 minutes).Interruptions (notifications, loud noises, social media, checking email etc.) harm your concentration.
Title: Busy doesn't mean productive Content: Busy work makes you feel like you are moving quickly and being productive in the process. But the truth is you are not. When you're busy, you're more likely to make poor time-management choices : for example, taking on commitments you can't handle, or prioritizing trifling tasks over crucial ones.
Title: Planning today for tomorrow Content: Before the day ends, identify and write down the best actions you need to take tomorrow. Every morning, focus on completing your action list from yesterday before midday.  Improve and repeat every day.
