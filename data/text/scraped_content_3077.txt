Title: 1. You Spend Significant Time Together Content: Outside of normal working hours and with all the things you could be doing in a day, there usually isn’t much time left over to spare. The fact that you and your significant other regularly choose to make time for each other is a good sign that you’re both committed.
Title: 2. You Include Each Other In Your Regular Purchases Content: Such acts of thoughtfulness may go from small and seemingly insignificant to as extravagant as buying matching jewelry. Keeping each other in mind to the point where you’re considering them in your regular purchases, you’re probably in a committed relationship.
Title: 3. You Get a Key Content: It’s a big demonstration of trust if one or both of you have keys to the other’s house. 
Title: 4. You do Social Media Shout-Outs Content: A public announcement on social media is usually a good sign that things are going well and that you’re both comfortable enough to broadcast your affection to the world.
Title: 5. YouSign Contracts Together Content: Going into a major contract (other than marriage) with someone, such as buying property or a car, is a sign that things are pretty serious between you. Contracts are a big deal because they’re generally harder to get out of than to get into, so signing together means you expect to be committed for a long time.
