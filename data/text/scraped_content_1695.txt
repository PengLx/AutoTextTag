Title: Don't reinvent the wheel Content: Mimic and get help from someone who’s already learned it to get tips and save time.In order to achieve mastery faster, our first step should be to consult the top players in the fieldand model the path they have already carved out for us.
Title: Deconstruct the skill Content: ...into its basic, fundamental components, tofind the most important things to practice first. This shows that very few things actually make a difference in any aspect of our lives, including learning. Use the Pareto Principle:which describes a goal of generating 80 percent of results by putting in 20 percent of the effort.
Title: Stop multitasking Content: Many of us aren’t able to dedicate the time it takes to learn a skill because of the countless new projects that come our way.Once you have deconstructed the subset skills that will give you the maximum amount of results, focus solely on improving those skills and avoid learning anything else until you’ve mastered them. 
Title: Repeat, repeat, repeat Content: Expert-level performance is primarily the result of expert-level practice, not due to innate talent.  Learning requires frequency and persistence in performing the same skill over and over again, until you can do it subconsciously, without having to think about it.
Title: Seek immediate feedback Content: The most effective learners actively seek feedback to enhance their performance.Feedback is necessary for a learner to confirm that s/he is on the right track.
Title: Go Long Content: Although it’s important to know when to quit, many potential winners don’t reach success because they quit before the dip.There’s a sense of euphoria we all experience when we begin something new. Once the honeymoon phase fades away, we experience the “dip” and our progress begins to plateau or diminish. This is when most of us quit.
