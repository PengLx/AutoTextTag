Title: The Meaning Of Kafkaesque Content: Franz Kafka, the German novelist who wrote the classic ‘Metamorphosis’ unintentionally made famous the word Kafkaesque, which is simply a situation so absurd, ironic and painfully bureaucratic (and unfair at the same time) that it borders on hilarity.
Title: Bureaucratic Insanity Content: There is a great amount of frustration that goes into any situation that is truly Kafkaesque, like fighting against a system where no matter how hard you pull and push, you will keep sinking deep into the abyss, the swamp which does not care about your interests or even your very existence.The many examples in the author’s works seem to suggest that bureaucracy does not exist to serve justice or to help anyone, but only to grow its own tentacles.
