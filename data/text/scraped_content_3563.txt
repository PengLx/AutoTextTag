It tells what is worth having in your life and gives you a way to get there; being satisfied with what you’ve got.Stoicism is centered around developing the ability to focus on what matters most and what you can control and ignore the rest. Thisis a rational approach to managing expectations and preparing for the inevitable difficulties of life.
Title: Cognitive Behavioural Therapy And Stoicism Content: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), is a “problem-focused” approach to psychological therapy and is seen as very effective against depression, anxiety and every kind of unhelpful thinking. Like stoicism, CBT encourages distinguishing between events and perceptions, and most CBT textbooks contain one of the core teachings of the Stoics: our perception hurts us more than the things themselves.
Title: The Problem With Stoicism Content: Practitioners may forget that some of the biggest determinants of our wellbeing are socio-economic and political if they follow too closely stoicism’s belief that circumstances can’t be changed and they must adapt. Doing so can needlessly perpetuate and aggravate harmful situations.
