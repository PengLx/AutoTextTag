Title: Self-Actualization: From Darkness To Light Content: Self-Actualization is an internal struggle that one must take by leaning towards stability and our higher goals while minimizing disruption from distracting thoughts and impulses (disruptive impulsivity). One also has to look out for oneself to not fall in the dark abyss of negativity and doubt, apart from feeling directionless or meaningless.
Title: The Paradox Of Self-Actualization Content: Self-actualization is the ultimate paradox,  in which by losing everything, one gains everything. It is the ultimate nothingness, the zero that is infinity at the same time.There is nothing to sacrifice in the process of self-actualization, even though it feels that way. One is freed of the bondage of the ego and is able to function with their full powers in the service of others.
