Title: Life is progress, not perfection Content: It doesn't work like a check-list: You can't check each item off, get to be happy and old for a couple of decades, then you die. Problems donâ€™t go away, they change and evolve.And accepting life's imperfection is hard because it forces us to accept that we have to live with things we donâ€™t like.
Title: Taking responsibility Content: Blaming the world for your problems is the easy way out.It gives you short-term relief, you lie in your imagined victimhood, but ultimately it implies that you are incapable of controlling your own fate.
Title: Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway Content: Bravery is not the absence of fear ðŸŒª. It's feeling the fear, the doubt, the insecurity, and deciding that something else is more important.
Title: Progress and happiness Content: In any venture, failure is required to make progress. Without failure, there is no progress and without progress, there is no happiness.
