Title: Transgenerational thinking Content: With this kind of thinking, you can develop and grow the way you think about problems, your role in solving them and the consequences.For parents, for example, this can mean asking themselves, right before resorting to an easy, short-term fix like giving to the kids the phone in order to enjoy a quiet dinner, this question: “Yes I can do that, but what is it teaching them?”
Title: Futures thinking Content: Usually when we're imagining the future, we always include in our visions about dealing with problems like poverty, climate change or cancer some techno-utopia solution (with all sorts of new technologies). And there is nothing wrong with that, but we should stop seeing the future in just this one way.Move from Future to Futures and open yourself up to considering all kinds of possible scenarios and all kinds of solutions.
Title: Telos thinking Content: Telos comes from the Greek language, and it means “ultimate aim” or “ultimate purpose.” This call for the process of asking yourself one question: “To what end?”As we try to solve a particular problem, we also should think about what will come after we solve it.
Title: Going beyond short-termism Content: We often feel like we don’t have control over the future, that it’s this thing we’re just waiting to wash over us. But we do have control, but it requires strategic thinking and action on our part, imagining many possible futures, and thinking beyond our own lifespans.
