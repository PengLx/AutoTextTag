Title: Social Inequality Content: Before we move towards a just society by going vocal globally, we need to cater to first place the injustice starts: Our Homes.We need to have some hard conversations with our near and dear ones to understand the genesis of inequality and injustice before we try to eradicate the problem on a large scale.We need to ask our loved ones how their beliefs, decisions, and choices came into being while keeping the conversation flowing by showing curiosity and not losing our temper.
Title: Tolerance and Broadening Our Mindsets Content: We need to find out how much tolerance we have of people that are different from us, whether it is their looks, background or belief patterns.We also need to bust the myth that feeling really strongly about someone does not mean that one is right. There are various online resources available like podcasts and videos that can educate individuals willing to understand reality and broaden their mindset about social inequality, diversity, and social justice.
