Title: Take Responsibility Content: If you know someone who possesses the following qualities, share this with themâ€”and also tell them how much you appreciate the fact they are in your life.Taking responsibility when things go wrong instead of blaming others isn't masochistic; it's empowering, because then you focus on doing things better or smarter next time.Find people who want to go where you're going. They'll work harder, have more fun, and create better business and personal relationships.No one likes you for your clothes, your car, your possessions, your title, or your accomplishments. Those are all "things." People may like your things, but that doesn't mean they like you.
