Title: We see ‘change’ as the magical answer to everything in life Content: “I just need a change of scenery.”“A new home will make us happier.”“A new relationship will make me feel whole again.”“I feel stuck in my job. I should get a new job.”“I need to change cities because I’m tired of the one I live in.”“I’ll be happy when I change my wardrobe.”
