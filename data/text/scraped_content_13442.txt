Title: The Bystander Effect Content: It happens when the presence of others discourages a person from intervening in an emergency situation. The greater the number of bystanders, the less likely it is for any one of them to provide help to a person that is in trouble or distress.People are more likely to take action in a crisis when there are few or no other witnesses present.
Title: Causes of the Bystander Effect Content: The Bystander effect is attributed to:The diffusion of responsibility: bystanders are less likely to intervene if there are other witnesses who seem likely to do so.Social influence: individuals observe the behavior of those around them to determine how to act.
Title: Being An Active Bystander Content: The Bystander effect can be reduced with awareness and in some cases explicit training.An active bystander is most effective when they assume that they are the only person taking charge; giving direction to other bystanders to assist can, therefore, be critically important.
