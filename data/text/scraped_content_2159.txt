Title: Visualize the destination Content: Take a moment to visualize the calm after the storm: the work is done and done well, and you’re celebrating with your team.Positive visualization can alleviate pressure and help you relax and stay focused, reminding you that even the most intense situations eventually resolve.
Title: Motivate yourself with a reward Content: People who know their hard work will be tangibly rewarded tend to perform better than those who don’t.Whether it’s a vacation, something you’ve been wanting to buy, or dinner at your favorite restaurant, pick a reward that will keep you going and pretend it’s already yours.
Title: Focus on your actions Content: Craft a routine or system for getting the work done. Focus on your daily actions and carry out your plan with discipline and determination.A routine can help prevent panic and distraction, allowing you to focus on the task at hand.
Title: Busy vs. Productive Content: Most of us think we’re accomplishing something as long as we’re busy doing things, but that’s not necessarily the truth. It’s a matter of doing the things that help us accomplish our goals.Look at the things you’re doing and delegate or eliminate all the unnecessary activities that are taking up your time and interfering with your success.
Title: Slow down to speed up Content: Instead of rushing into things because we feel pressured to do something, the better approach is to slow down,think about what you want to do and take some time to formulate a plan.Give yourself the space to be creative, innovative and productive instead of just reacting in the moment.
Title: Take control where you can Content: ... and let go where you can’t. When you focus on the things you can’t control, the pressure—and your anxiety—are intensified. Focus on the things you can control and let the rest take care of itself.
