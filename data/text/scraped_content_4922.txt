Title: How to be happy Content: How to be happy does not depend on money, power, or luck, but on human relations.Our level of joy in life is determined by the quality of our interaction with others. We are more satisfied in an environment where we have solidarity, support,  and a sense of belonging.
Title: Solidarity Content: We are shaped and influenced by our surroundings at every moment of our lives, through our family, work, and the media. The ideal framework for people to be happy is where everyone cares for each other.  This is also a solid ground for children to thrive in.
Title: Selfishness prevents happiness Content: It is naive to think that we will become happy if we continue being controlled by our selfish nature. Competition and achievement for personal gain do not lead to happiness.Encourage close bonds of unity and love, as happiness lies therein.
