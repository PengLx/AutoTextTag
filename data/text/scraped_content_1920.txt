Title: Figure out your morning flow Content: Starting your day on a high note sets the tone for the rest of your day (or even week).Think about the one thing that boosts your mood in the morning and incorporate it into your routine. Whatever it is, stick to it as that’ll give you a clear mind and set you up for a productive day.
Title: Take regular breaks Content: Not looking away from the computer doesn’t translate into productivity. A good way to boost your motivation throughout the day is to take small exercise breaks.You can do anything from stretches to treadmill runs, just to get your blood flowing and boost your brain function by moving your body. It also sets the tone for a more energetic afternoon.
Title: Write it all down Content: Mapping your goals in a visual way is key, as seeing them makes them more real. You’re more likely to follow through on your ideas if you pen them.Write down your top priorities and designate ways and blocks of time to tackle them. Also minimize distractions (i.e., social media notifications, alarms, news alerts, etc.) to get these things done.
Title: Maintain your work environment Content: We work better when our environment is clean and organized. Whatever you consider organized, be sure to regularly clean up your workspace and get rid of unnecessary things.Changing your location, especially during a creative block, can also significantly improve your performance and reboot your creativity.
