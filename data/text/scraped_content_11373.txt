Title: Estimating the disorder Content: The entropy law, or the second law of thermodynamics, has as object of study the disorder within a system. The bigger the system and the more the molecules and atoms within, the more the entropy contained.
Title: The confusing nature of entropy Content: In big lines, entropy can be defined as a measure of disorder of a system.
