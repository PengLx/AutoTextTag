Title: Luck is a perceptual bias Content: In other people, we focus on the successful result, not the struggle and growth experiences they endured to reach it, while in ourselves, all weâ€™re aware of is the struggle we endure and not the success that is readily apparent to others.
Title: We control our luck Content: ... to a certain extent. We may not directly affect major opportunities of our life at any given moment (like finding oil on our property), but we can indirectly influence how many opportunities spring up and the ferocity with which we pursue them.
Title: Become a lucky person Content: Be a social butterfly: Lucky people enjoy relating to other people.Periodically do something stupid: Luck is more likely to fall on those who take a dumb risk or two.Maximize your positive luck and minimize the negative one.Be optimistic: Our performance usually rises to the level of our expectations.
