Title: Walking backwards Content: Backwards walking(whether real, imaginary, or virtual)can boost your short-term memory.To go back in time, it might help to go backwards in space. Moving backwards through space appears to carry the our minds backward along that subjective timeline toward the point at which the remembered information was encoded, thus improving our recall.
Title: Drawing to remember Content: When we draw something we are forced to consider in more detail and it’s this deeper processing that makes us more likely to remember it. Even writing a list helps somehow, which is why when you get to the shop and realise you’ve left your shopping list at home, you can still remember more items than if you hadn’twritten a list at all. However, doing a drawing takes it one step further.
Title: Exercise, but get the timing right Content: When you want to learn something in particular, then physical effort does seem to help, at least in the short-term.In an experiment, people that did 35 minutes of interval training 4 hours after learning a list of pictures paired with locations were better at remembering the pairs than those who did the interval training straight away.
Title: Taking mental breaks Content: For healthy people, a short breakimmediatelyafter learning something makes a difference to how much they could remember a whole week later the learning took place.New memories are fragile, so even a short break can make a difference to whether they hang around or disappear.
Title: Sleep and memory Content: Sleep is thought to help consolidate our memories by replaying or reactivating the information we’ve just learned.That sleepdoesn’t have to happen at night.   Naps work too, bur mostly forpeople who are accustomed to regularly taking a nap in the afternoon.
