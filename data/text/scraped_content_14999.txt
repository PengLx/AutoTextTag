Title: More than one way to reach your destination Content: Willpower is known to be a limited resource.Most people focus on how to increase willpower with exercises and strategies to make themselves more productive. That is useful, but willpower alone will not help you reach your destination. Finding other ways to stay on track can increase your progress.
Title: Changing your default thinking Content: You have conscious control of about 10% of your brain. Most of your judgments, prioritizations, decisions, and actions are happening in your subconscious. Many of these processes are running on default programs to maintain the current position.One reason change is hard is that you're often working against these defaults. You can change the defaults by giving your brain a concrete goal.
Title: Set your autopilot Content: A well worked out goal sets the compass in your subconscious. It's not going to change your bad habits instantly but will serve as a guide when you make a choice.When your brain is set on a course, it helps those default programs work for you instead of against you.
Title: Setting your navigation Content: You can't just tell your brain to get to work on a goal. There are some steps to take.Believe it can happen. Aim for something small enough to take you in the right direction.Identify a few actions you need to take. Make two lists: specific steps that need to happen, and repeated actions that need to be taken.Set a timeline for your specific steps. Understanding what you need to accomplish this week helps your brain to keep you on track.Designate a time to review and revise. Life will probably not follow the exact timeline or milestones you planned. Regular evaluation once a month will help you to readjust and try again.
