Title: The Invisible Illness Called Depression Content: Depression is a serious mental illness and can be overlooked by friends and family because the depressed person expends precious energy just to camouflage the problem. Depression is like a chameleon for therapists as it has different manifestations for different individuals based on their age, gender and a cocktail of other emotional issues that form a unique package.
Title: The Manifestations Of Depression Content: Women under depression usually exhibit sadness, guilt, hormonal changes, among other seemingly unrelated symptoms. Men can get irritable, exhausted and start having sleep issues. They then get into drugs and alcohol, or start to overwork in order to distract themselves.Kids under depression usually start to sulk, feel lonely and misunderstood, or have long periods of irritability.
Title: Mindfulness As Part Of Treatment Content: The common treatments of depression are antidepressant medications and therapy, which has a large relapse rate.However, if mindfulness is part of the treatment, the relapse rate declines. What is being pointed out is that mindfulness is effective when it is part of a treatment, and not so much on its own.
Title: Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) Content: This is a therapeutic treatment combining cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and mindfulness practices. MBCT helps the depressed person understand that 1) Thoughts are not facts; and 2) Depression is not to be identified with.MBCT takes care of our behavioural patterns as well as our thought patterns, making the treatment a thorough approach towards depression, taking care of the mind and body.
