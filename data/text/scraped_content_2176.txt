Title: Force yourself to do things Content: Our mind has muscles. It memorizes patterns. By doing this over and over, you're building your willpower and self-discipline.Forcing yourself to do things that you don't feel like doing (but you know you should be doing) is a habit you can learn.
Title:  Content: "People often say that motivation doesn't last. Well, neither does bathing - that's why we recommend it daily."
Title: Focus on the emotional reward Content: Focus on the feeling you feel after doing something that you know is good for you.The adrenaline rush. The feeling of being fit and healthy. The relief you feel after having finished a big project. The pride you gain from an accomplishment. The confidence you feel after having faced your fear.
Title: Track your goals periodically Content: Writing things down is a way to reinforce to our subconscious what we want.The more we tell ourselves what we want to achieve, the more likely we are to take action.Start with the habit of tracking your goals because tracking your goals is making a commitment to those goals.
Title: Set a reward for yourself Content: Rewards can keep us motivated. And if a reward can keep us motivated for 30 days, then we might have successfully changed our habit by then too. Pick a healthy reward for yourself.
Title: Find someone to hold you accountable Content: Instead of tracking your goals yourself, you can ask someone you trust to keep you on track with your goals. This can be a sibling, friend, partner, or even a professional such as a life coach or a personal trainer.They can be your source of motivation and inspiration.
