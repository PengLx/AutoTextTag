Until there is nothing left in me to give. That makes me special and unique.I did the first 20 minutes without much of a problem, but then it got hard. I wanted to quit, but I didn't. I just began to do the movements the way I could until I could catch up. Occasionally I would have to stop and start again, but I refused to quit. As you have guessed by now, I finished the class, and I felt great! Tired, but great!The reason I wanted to write about this is because life is like that sometimes. I had quitted some things in my life when it got hard, but the things that I struggled with and finished are the things I am most proud of. When the work is being done, the heart is hurting, and you feel like you just can't take another moment of whatever it is that you are reaching for, it is essential to know that you are probably almost there.When I reached the peak in my exercise class and thought I couldn't make it, I pushed and allowed the sweat to fall down my back, and then to my relief, the instructor began the cool-down movements. Just when I thought I was going to have to quit again, I had made it.
