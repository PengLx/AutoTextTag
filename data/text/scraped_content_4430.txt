Title: The State of Flow Content: Being in flow means focusing your complete attention on the task in front of you. It is an underrated aspect of our happiness at work.Flow requires simplicity: if a task is too hard, it will become frustrating too easy and you'll be bored. 
Title: Make Frustrating Tasks Easier Content: Work tasks are rarely chosen by you, so they rarely have optimal difficulty. To make them more likely to produce flow:Slow down on your work and let go of the expectations you have related to your tasks.Complex tasks can seem very overwhelming and frustrating. So break them up into more manageable sub-tasks.Lower your standards temporarily to get the faucet running. Perfectionism will not help you in this case.
Title: Make Boring Tasks More Interesting Content: You tend to start daydreaming spontaneously when you don’t have something harder to do. To make boring tasks more engaging:Up your game.  Even a slight increase in standards is often enough to make your focus sharper.Measure your performance, keep track of it as you go and make the stakes higher for whatever you’re doing.Do it differently. If you change up your explicit strategy, removing the ability to do it by rote, you can increase engagement.
