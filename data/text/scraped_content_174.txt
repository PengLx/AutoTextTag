Title: The Compounding Effect of Habits Content: The progress we experience from the compounding effect of any habit isn’t immediately visible. As a result, people give up quickly.They don’t realize that every day they show up they’re building momentum. They are moving closer and closer to a breakthrough or inflection point.
Title: Consistency matters more than frequency Content: We usually make effort unsustainable. For example:We work out like crazy for a few days (usually at the beginning of the year) and never go back to the gym.We try to meditate for 30 mins one day and don’t give it another shot until 10 days laterBut when it comes to developing and maintaining a new habit, frequency matters more than intensity.
Title: Identity-based Habits Content: To build the identity of the person you want to become, ask yourself what the behavior of a person who has the habit you want to develop is. For example:What is the behavior a person who is in shape? They go to the gym consistentlyWhat is the behavior of a prolific writer? They crack open a notebook every day.
Title: Raise Your Level of Intensity Gradually Content: When something becomes effortless, raise the level of intensity, to the point where you can get there without too much resistance, but it’s still somewhat challenging. To put it more concisely, bend but don’t break.
