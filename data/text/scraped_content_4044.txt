Title: Self-imposed deadlines Content: When faced with a difficult decision, set a date or time for you to come to a conclusion.  Doing this forces a habit of self-trust.You will be right sometimes, and other times you'll be wrong. However, making a decision is more important than waiting for an outside force to decide for you.
Title: Perfect is not the goal Content: Many mediocre business people become successful just because they get things done.Being smart or well-positioned or creative helps, but only second to progress - the ability to move from point A to point B to point C.
Title: Empowering people Content: One of the root causes of analysis paralysis is that CEOs and founders built their organization to depend upon them.As a leader, your responsibility is not to make every decision yourself, but to create systems and a culture that empowers people to make educated decisions on their own.Ask yourself how you can instil the same level of self-trust in those around you.
