Title: Make employee experience a priority Content: 96% of talent professionals agree that employee experience is very important, to the point of becoming mission-critical.Whether you’re a leader overseeing a 500-person organization or a manager with a team of two, we all need to find ways to create experiences to connect more deeply and humanly with our teams..
Title: Talent and opportunity Content: Talent may be evenly distributed, but opportunity is not. It could take some time and cumulative action to build a more diverse workforce, but sometimes the simplest of measures can add up to major changes.At Shopify, for example, the company rethought the requirements on their job descriptions. On each job post, it encourages job seekers to apply even if they don’t necessarily meet all the requirements that are listed.
Title: Using your brand to tell authentic stories Content: One of the most helpful things you can do for your employer brand at the moment is to help employees and those interested in joining your company see beyond just your value proposition, to your actual values.In the future, this will become even more important as companies continue to recognize the importance of taking a more empathetic, human tone in their messaging and telling authentic stories that reveal their company’s values and purpose.
Title: Adjust to changing times Content: In the face of a constant stream of new information change and new customer habits, it’s very difficult to predict what the future will look like.But it’s possible to find ways to stay alert by listening carefully to your customers and enabling your workforce to move quickly on new strategies that align with your mission.
