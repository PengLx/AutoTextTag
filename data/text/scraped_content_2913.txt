Title: Paper clutter Content: Paperwork is one of the toughest forms of clutter to vanquish.Often, it’s much more anxiety-provoking and draining than going through a clothes closet or a desk drawer.
Title: To decide what to keep  Content: Ask yourself:Do you actually need this piece of paper or receipt?Will it quickly become dated?Will I find a replacement on the internet? For example, instruction manuals.What’s the consequence of not having it if you do need it?Could you scan it, so that you have a copy if you need it?At work or at home, does someone else have a copy of this information?
Title: Worrying about regret Content: Some people think they'll regret getting rid of papers and wished they'd kept some of it.You can create a holding box: put papers in that box for six months—or even a year, if you're really worried—and see if you ever need to retrieve anything from that box. If you don't, get rid of the box
Title: Getting too organized Content: We want to get organized, but not too organized.Don't make files so specific that you can't find anything later, or so that you spend all your time labeling files.
