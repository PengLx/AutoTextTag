Title: Perfect Vs Good Enough Content: For work that is not mission-critical, sometimes it is better to be just good enough, instead of being perfect.Striving for 'Good Enough' instead of perfect can increase productivity if done rightly.
Title: Minimum Viable Product Content: The Minimum Viable Product is the simplest, most basic form of a product or service, which can be sold in the market. This doesn't have all of the bells and whistles but has enough features to work. Basically, it is good enough but not perfect.Releasing an MVP allows one to get feedback at an early stage, and improve the product later on.
Title: First of its Kind Content: If a product is being launched in the market that is new and does not have competition, then launching it with bare minimum features is the right way.MVP (Minimum Viable Product) strategy does not work for a generic product.
Title: A New Project Content: If you already have a big, successful product in the market and want to launch a new, not-so-perfect product, it may not be a great idea.Launching a bare-bones product is more suitable for early-stage companies.
Title: Providing Value Content: If a product isn't perfect, the thing to consider is if it provides value to the user as it is, or not.If there are some omissions or inconveniences, one has to figure out if it is still worth putting in the market or wait until it is in better shape.
