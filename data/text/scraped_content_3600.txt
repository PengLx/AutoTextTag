Title: External events don't harm us  Content: Even if this sounds counterintuitive, only our responses to them can have this effect.These events only have the power that we choose to give them. They only destroy us because we think they are destructive, and allow them to run our lives.
Title: Maintaining control over our lives Content: The occurrence of a bad event does not necessarily have to result in sadness.If we take away the power of external events and reclaim our internal power to decide, gage, and assign value, we maintain control of our lives.
Title: We're not immune to loss Content: We are going to experience negative emotions in life (anger, sadness, heartbreak, etc.)And recognizing that our mindset is not at the mercy of external events, but rather something that is under our own control can go a long way in fostering a healthier, happier outlook.
