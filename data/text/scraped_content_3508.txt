Title: Live Every Day as If It Were Your Last Content: Death doesn’t make life pointless, death makes life worth living. Sometimes the discussion about the meaning of life serves no purpose besides distracting you from the answer, which is found in front of you when you live your life.When you wake up, pretend today is your last day and live life as you would in this circumstance. And don’t just think, do.
Title: Food as a Test Of Self-Control Content: Although eating food is pleasurable, digesting it is our main purpose. We should eat to live rather than live to eat.To practice this principle, one can eat plain foods without sauces or try intermittent fasting.
Title: Failure Is Natural, Regret Is Foolish Content: We should learn from the past, but to regret it and then look at it with disdain brings nothing but frustration and anger. There is no reward for dwelling on what you cannot control, the past.To build character, expect and embrace failure, then seek obstacles that seem uncomfortable. Practicing negative visualization (envisioning the worst possible scenario so you can better appreciate the present) also helps.
Title: Focus On The Small Things Content: Never underestimate the small things in life, as they define the larger and more important ones. Everything is worth paying attention to for all experiences and outcomes in life are interlinked.Don’t place your satisfaction on big goals and dreams, place your satisfaction on small wins. Consistently having small wins is what usually leads to success.
Title: Don’t Be Vain Content: Throw away conceit and pride before you study any subject. Doing so lets you learn, evolve and develop through the wisdom of others and through embracing the joy of ignorance.
