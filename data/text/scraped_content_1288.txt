Title: The Importance Of Research On Reading Habits Content: A study found that students who read texts in print scored significantly better on the reading comprehension test than students who read the texts digitally. Empirical evidence also indicates that affordances of screen devices might negatively impact cognitive and emotional aspects of reading.These studies add to the much-needed body of research on the effects of media substrate on humans. Itâ€™s important to provide research and evidence-based knowledge to publishers on what kind of devices (iPad, Kindle, print) should be used for what kind of content.
