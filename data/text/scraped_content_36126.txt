So far the only podcasts I know of that fit this are King Falls AM, Qwerpline, and Welcome to Nightvale. Are there any other serialized podcasts like this out there? I'm especially a fan of plot heavy ones, but "monster of the week-esque" are always fun as well. Thanks!Wormwood?Absolutely! Check out Uncanny County!Also you might enjoy Small Town Horror (horror), Hector vs The Future (Comedy, Wooden Overcoats (Comedy), The Tunnels (horror), and Mabel (suspense?)

Title: pod 3 Content: Knifepoint Horror is an anthology series, but each episode feels very "lonely". Give an episode a listen to see if you're into it. It's a simple format, but it's done in a way that sets it apart from a lot of other series, and it has a lot of fans because of it.Sable is exactly what you want. It's about a creepy small town and the people and beings that live there.Give Bellingham Terror a try. Set in a small town in 1935 Pacific Northwest, it is worth a try. www.bellinghamterror.com Passage is about a larger mystery of a missing ship but much of the show is about the town of Port Possession and the secrets within.
