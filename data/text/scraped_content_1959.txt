Title: How To Make Better Decisions Content: Analyze objectively your assumptions, feelings and expectations.Focusing only on the problem limits options for a solution and leads to energy depletion and decisions out of anxiety and frustration. Expand your perspective to be able to see other things, and often a solution will appear somewhere in the composition.Rather than thinking in terms of bad and good when making decision, try to see a more balanced view by embracing the uncertainty of every situation.
