Title: Get rid of what distracts you Content: Don’t waste your time and energy trying to manage it. Don’t even try setting time limits, no one is so strong to resist the urge.If you want to lose weight for example, stop buying junk food. Don’t allow snacks in your house.
Title: If something doesn’t give you energy, remove it Content: We can achieve anything if we only focus on one thing at a time. You only have so much time and energy.And maybe it's time to get rid of the project that has been on your to-do list for 3 years. It’s time to say goodbye to the friends you’re not that close with.
