Title: Changing and creating habits Content: The best way to break a bad habit is to make it hard, even impossible to do. And the best way to create a good habit is to automate it so you never have to think about it again.
Title: Locking in good habits Content: Nutrition: Use smaller plates to reduce caloric intake.Sleep: Remove your television from the bedroom.Productivity: Delete games and social media apps from the phone.Happiness: Get a dog.Finance:Call your service providers (cable, electric, etc.) and ask for a lower rate.These one-time actions only require effort once.
Title: Habits that benefit from automation Content: Automation is useful for behaviors that happen too infrequently to become habitual: Things you have to do monthly or yearly (rebalancing your investment portfolio or e.g.) are never repeated frequently enough to become a habit, so they benefit in particular from technology “remembering” to do them for you.
Title: The Downside of Automation Content: Technology creates a level of convenience that can work against us: Binge watching becomes a habit because it takes more effort to stop looking at the screen than to continue doing so. Instead of pressing a button to advance to the next episode, Netflix or YouTube will autoplay it for you.
