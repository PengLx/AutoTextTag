Title: Confirmation Bias Content: If you already have an opinion about something before you've even tried to figure it out, chances are you'll over-value information that confirms that opinion.Think about what kinds of information you would expect to find to support alternative outcomes.

Title: Anchoring Bias Content: When we’re evaluating an option, we often fixate on the first piece of information we have about it.Decide in advance what outcome you have in mind.
Title: The Sunk Cost Fallacy Content: “Sunk costs” are money, time, or effort we’ve already spent and can’t get back.Cultivate a habit of admitting your mistakes. Ask yourself: If the past didn’t exist and you’re just starting out now, what would you do?”
