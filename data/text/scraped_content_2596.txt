Title: Take a Deep Breath Content: Taking a deep breath will take away that stressful or anxious feeling that builds in your chest. Stepping back to focus on your breath for a second, allows you to respond instead of reacting purely on that emotional buildup.
Title: Put That Moment Into Perspective Content: When you react in a short-tempered manner you need to ask yourself if what happened in the moment was the cause or it was something deeper that had been building up and burst.Step back and take a deep breath while thinking about this very moment. Is it even that big of a deal to react in such a way that impacts not only you but the other person?
Title: Think About The Recipient Content: When you react instead of respond, you might feel guilty. But make an effort to try to think how the other person feels and how they perceive you now.If this is a recurring theme itâ€™s now become the total perception they have on you.
Title: Apologize Immediately Content: Try to be open and honest and sincerely apologize. The alternative is to let the negativity linger throughout your relationships.Stress that the cause of your actions has nothing to do with the moment, and more importantly, has nothing to do with the other person. The more open and honest we are with each other the more trusting and deeper our relationships become.
Title: Reflect Content: You need to dig deeper into why that reaction occurred. Think about the surroundings or environment that may have led to such a reaction.Take some time each day and dedicate it to reflection; just fifteen to twenty minutes. However you do it, reflect and express, preferably in writing.
