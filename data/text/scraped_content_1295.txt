Title: Voice Modulation Content: You modulate your voice when you change pitch, like when your voice goes up at the end of a question.Just like with music, its rhythm and tone can convey a meaning that may be different than the literal interpretation of your words.Being able to modulate your voice correctly is a powerful tool.
Title: Use Voice Modulation to Improve Your Speaking Voice Content: If you want your audience to quiet down, to be calm or to perhaps hang on your every word, speak more quietly. f you want to rile up your audience, speak with a stronger voice. You can also use volume to convey your passion.Try not to speak too quickly. Most audiences will have trouble following along. Instead, speak at a moderate pace.Slowing down your speech even more will emphasize each word.
Title: Working With Microphones Content: Microphones just make any speaking mistakes or tics louder and easier for your audience to detect.Practice speaking with a microphone before your performance and record your speech.This will help you detect words you have pronounced too loudly and times when hard consonants have caused feedback with the sound system.
