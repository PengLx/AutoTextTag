Title: Fitness in Our Genes Content: A new study on the genetics of fitness is trying to find out if the body's receptivity to exercise is genetic or not.The researchers have looked at thousands of individual segments of DNA, which are called single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and identified a particular gene that responds to exercise by a measurement called maximum oxygen capacity.
Title: Gene For Metabolizing Fats Content: A particular gene known as ACSL1 seems to play a role in how a body metabolizes fats and subsequently affects exercise response.The findings, though preliminary, do point towards exercise benefits being genetic. Still, exercise has a multitude of benefits and cannot be discarded by individuals who do not have a certain type of gene.
