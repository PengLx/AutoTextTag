Title: The greatest motivation Content: The most motivational statement comes down to three words: “You’re gonna die.”You get one life and one chance to make yourself happy. Instead of sitting and complaining about not pursuing the things you want in life, do something about it.
Title: The life you want Content: No matter your age, you have the time to make yourself happy:If you’re in your early 20s, most likely you don't have major life commitments, so this is the time to take the chance on the life you want: travel, experiment with your talents, start networking.If you’re in your 40s, 50s, 60s, or older, instead of retiring and taking up golf, maybe it’s time to triple down and really focus on what you want.
Title: Stop making excuses Content: There’s this tendency people have to pass over opportunities when they think they can just “come back to it later.” People are living their lives like they have unlimited time.The biggest poison we encounter as humans is regret, so stop making excuses and start making yourself happy.
