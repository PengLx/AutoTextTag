Title: Morning Pages for a productive day Content:  The Morning Pages technique acts as a mind dump to get rid of the clutter in your brain. Every morning, take a pen and 3 blank pages and fill up those free blank pages with words. This makes you slow down at the start of the day and clear your mind of all the junk that's floating around in it.
