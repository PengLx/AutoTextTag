Title: Love at first sight...or not Content: When choosing our partner, looks play a decisive role. Research has shown that features such as symmetrical faces, good health, or female traits (when it comes to women) might prove quite essential when deciding whether the person in front of us is worth or not taking the risk of starting a relationship.
Title: The language style on a date Content: While physical attraction will never cease to be an essential component of a relationship, it does have strong competition when talking about communication.The fact that both partners share the same language style can only have positive effects on their future together. Language is also a sure means to see if somebody is having the time of their life or just another wasted evening.
Title: Your partner's personal signature Content: Whenever you go on a date, you tend to pay attention to some aspects more than to others. Therefore, individuals find themselves judging the person across the table by taking into account his or her smell, hairiness, taste of their kiss, and so on.All these do not only provide one with important information about the person's lifestyle, but they also say more than enough about their health and personal habit. So you better pay attention to these details next time you are on a date, as they behave like the other one's signature.
