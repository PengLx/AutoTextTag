Title: Body Language Content: While body language cues can offer clues to deceptions, it is often not good enough. More accurate signals are:Intentionally leaving out important details.If the person seems unsure or insecure.Shrugging, lack of expression, and a bored posture.Thinking too hard to fill in the details of the story.
