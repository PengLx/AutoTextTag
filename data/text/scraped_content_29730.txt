Title: The Rule of Awkward Silence Content: When faced with a challenging question, instead of answering, you pause and think deeply, 10, 20s or more, about how you want to answer. Lots of top execs are doing it: At Apple, Tim Cook is famous for long, uncomfortable pauses. Steve Jobs was the same, taking 20 seconds to think before responding to an insult. At Amazon, Bezos takes up to 30 minutes, to read printed memos in silence before meetings.
