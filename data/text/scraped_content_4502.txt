Title: Losing a Loved One Content: Extreme grief, like losing a loved one is normally handled by an individual's support group of friends and family in stereotypical ways.There seems to be a 'support gap' in which positive emotions like hope, gratitude, kindness, bravery, and resilience hardly find any mention during the grieving period.
Title: Choose Life Content: The key is to choose life, and not lose the ones we have, to what we have already lost.Accepting the good and deciding to shift towards life during matters of death is an effective psychological technique, which is referred to as 'benefit finding'.
Title: Resilient People Content: Studies after the 9/11 terror attacks showed that experiencing positive emotions created a buffer against depression. Resilient people can work out ways to include hope, love, humor, pride, inspiration, serenity into their lives.We all can use nature therapy, inspirational movies, and books, music, and sports to fuel our positive beliefs and emotions.
Title: Rituals Are Important Content: Participating in rituals returns a feeling of control to the bereaved, and people who practice rituals are reported to be feeling lower levels of grief.Even small acts that make us think of the departed soul, like wearing their jewelry, or making their favorite dish in loving memory, keep the 'love communication' alive. We need to know that even when someone is gone, it is okay to keep loving and remembering them.
