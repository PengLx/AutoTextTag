Title: The basics to succeed in the gym: Content: Commit to the long-term process.Don't treat exercise as something to do when it's convenient.Great results come from great focus, not a great variety.Start light and train for volume before intensity.Make SLOW progress each week.Record your workouts. What gets measured, gets managed.
Title: Don't focus on the short-term results Content: The goal is not to lose 40 pounds in the next 12 weeks, but to regain your health for the rest of your life.The goal is not to bench press 300 pounds, but to be the guy who never misses a workout.The goal is not to sacrifice everything to get your fastest time in next month's race, but to be faster next year than you are today.
Title: Focus on the best exercises Content: People often waste time in the gym bouncing around without any real goal, doing a little bit of this machine and a little bit of that machine.The simple rule that will always guide you toward the best exercises: the more an exercise makes you move, the bigger the benefits it will deliver.
Title: Workouts should be easy in the beginning Content: The biggest mistake that most people make is not building a foundation of strength.Build the capacity to do the work before you start testing your limits. Volume doesn't have to mean â€œdo sets of 20 reps". You can think of volume over a period of weeks and months.
