Title: Sleep stability: the key to a good night's sleep Content: Sleep stability means pinning your bedtime to the same time every night, even on weekends, and waking up at the same time every morning, even on weekends.It's important to settle into a groove or a cycle that your body understands and responds to. Once you do this, you’ll sleep better, feel better, have more energy, and worry less.
Title: The "8-hour sleep" myth Content: 8 hours of sleep/night is a useful goal, but it’s not true that everyone needs that. A lot of people get obsessed with this goal of getting 8 hours of sleep every single night, and because they’re someone who just doesn’t need that much sleep, or they can’t reliably sleep that long, they get anxious about it and that actually creates issues with insomnia.
Title: Basic sleep hygiene for a good night Content: not drinking caffeine after middaynot exercising too latenot drinking alcohol before bedeating sensiblyleaving mobile devices outside the bedroom (artificial light disrupts the brain).If doing natural things like this doesn’t work, then it might be wise to consult with a specialist or a doctor.
Title: Get out of bed Content: The bedroom should be for sleeping. If you’re lying in bed for more than 15 minutes and not sleeping, just get out and leave the room.Staying in bed while you’re anxious or not sleeping is one of the most common contributors to chronic insomnia because it trains the brain to create bad associations. So you have to break that.
