Our confidence increases or decreases based on our ability to make progress.Any progress builds momentum (and your mood): No matter how small the task is, crossing it off your to-do list gives you a boost of momentum and enhances your mood.Small steps turn into habits: When a task is easy to do and quickly completed, it’s much easier to turn it into a habit.
Title: The hard thing about small tasks Content: We're pretty bad at estimating how much time a task will take, even if we’ve done that task before.When you’re trying to implement the 2-minute rule, you might find yourself spending hours on that “easy” email you wanted to write.
Title: For more mental space and focus Content: Answer the “why” and “what” for each of your regularly scheduled meetings.Set office hours for interruptions, emails, and conversations.Clean up your desk (and your desktop).
