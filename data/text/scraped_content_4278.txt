Title: Social Narrowing Content: Social Narrowing is a subconscious process in which we are spending time with people who are similar to us.This phenomenon can be a problem when we need new resources, ideas or a new career.
Title: Change Your Filters Content: When we meet people, we look at them and subconsciously make a decision in our heads about their importance, relevancy or their being of any interest to us.The challenge is to fight these filters and invite people in your life who are of the least interest to you.Identify and connect with people whom you wouldn't normally connect with, adding diversity to your social universe.
Title: People We Don't Reach Out To Content: The lower your socioeconomic status is, the less diverse are your social networks, as we choose to reach inwards for advice, instead of outwards.The tweak to apply here is to reach out and ask for advice with the network of people whom you normally will not connect with.Remind yourself of your strengths and values, if you feel intimidated by wanting to take advice out of your comfort zone.
Title: Give and Take Content: If we help someone professionally, we can use that as a chance to connect with them in the future, and building bridges and relations with new people whom we wouldn't normally go and connect with.
