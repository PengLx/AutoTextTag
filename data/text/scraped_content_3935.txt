Title: The Productivity Systems Flaw Content: Many productivity books provide various systems to organize your life but fail to take into account people who are not focused or motivated in the first place.Lack of focus and motivation is the key reason people fail to get any help from these methods.
Title: OKR (Objectives and Key Results) Content: The OKR (Objectives and Key Results) method helps you decide on and stick to a practical goal and then define what it would look like to have that goal completed.For example, if you want to read a book a week, the Key Result would be reading 52 books a year, and the Objective can be to be a better writer.
Title: Defining OKRs Content: A meaningful goal-setting (Objective + Key Result) can be figured out by asking:What you want your life to be like (Objective) and what would you do if your life became like that (Key Result).
Title: OKR is a Compass Content: The OKR system is not a task, but a motivational driver, a compass pointing you towards your key results and life goals.The Objective part shows you what will happen if you continue following your daily tasks.
Title: Checks and Follow-ups Content: OKR systems tell you if what you are doing is on the right track. You would need to check-in and review yourself weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual basis, checking your purpose and well as progress.
