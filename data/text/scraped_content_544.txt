Title:  Content: One of the most common difficulties with getting to sleep is people just can’t turn their minds off. According to the American Psychological Association, 43 percent of Americans say stress has caused them to lie awake at night at least once a month.
Title: Encourage positive distractions Content: Focusing all your attention on how you can’t get to sleep will only make sleep more difficult. Instead, distract yourself with engaging imagery, involving as many as your senses as possible.For example, close your eyes and picture a nice beach—can you hear the crashing of waves? Feel the sun on your skin? Taste the salt from the sea?
Title: Allow worrisome thoughts Content: If you’re unable to sleep because you’re fixated on something stressful that’s happening the next day, it’s common to want to push those thoughts from your mind. However, doing so may hurt more than it helps. Remembering the mundane tasks that follow something stressful, can help you recognize that the panic will pass.
Title: Practice nightly mindfulness Content: Often when we’re wide awake worrying, we’re focused on something that’s happening in the future. Mindfulness can be a powerful antidote as it directs your attention towards what’s happening in the present: focus on your breathing or focus physical sensations like how warm your bed sheets feel.
