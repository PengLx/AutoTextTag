Title: Conversation Killers Content: Words are like keys that can make or break a conversation. Some words look absolutely okay to us, but can kill a conversation if they sound mechanical or are overused.Words like Awesome, Right On, Fantastic, Fabulous, if overused, sound fluffy and mechanical, with no warmth or feeling behind them.
Title: Conversation Killers: Asking For An Outside Perspective Content: You can be conscious of what you type in your emails and phone messages, it pays well to have a large vocabulary at your disposal.If you overuse a word, or say a ‘pet’ word without even realizing it, you may have to break the habit by taking help from a colleague, friend or family member.The person who gets your message, who may be a new friend or an acquaintance, can feel as if you are being sarcastic, or may have misused a word, which they may or may not correct you. They may even think they have missed part of the conversation.Too many fluffy words also drown out the actual conversation. If you go on and on, the message you are trying to convey gets diluted.
Title: Sharing Personal Information Content: The more you talk, the more personal information is divulged. Your likes and dislikes, thought patterns, preferences, everything is exposed. It feels good and comforting to talk if the other person is listening, but good communication is never about talking too much.Say less and listen more.
