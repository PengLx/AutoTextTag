Title: Codependence Content: Society teaches us an unhealthy kind of love, telling us that we are to search for one elusive, a mystical being that completes us in all aspects. Love need not be codependent, scarce and elusive but can be independent.When we look for approval from others, taking the preferences of people closest to us in hopes of acceptance, we become codependent, and when we become frustrated with this co-dependence, we protect ourselves by being manipulative, evasive and passive-aggressive.
Title: Towards Independence Content: To defeat co-dependence:Identify the problem.Identify associated thought patterns.Identify the cost of stagnation.Identify the rewards of growth.MeditationMeditation aids our independence from others, helping us become complete and rooted. Meditation provides us with an inner growth that makes us independent and self-sufficient mentally, spiritually and emotionally. It helps us figure out who we are from inside.
