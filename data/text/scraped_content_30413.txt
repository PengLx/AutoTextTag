Title: Islam is a religion of nature, so why are people becoming atheists? * Content: ** Islam is a religion of nature, so has nature changed in the present era? *Interview of Hazrat Maulana Mufti Muhammad Taqi Usmani* Question: * We read in the books that Islam is a natural religion and with the passage of time it is capable of fulfilling the requirements of all times but on the contrary we believe that the nature of man in the present ageThey have turned away from Islam and people have turned away from Islam.* Answer: * Look!What is called human nature does not change with the passage of time, it is always the same.The confusion in your mind is actually due to the fact that the true meaning of nature is not clear, so first understand what is called "nature".It is actually an Arabic word which literally means: birth, creation, and the naturalness of a human being. It means that when the Almighty created man, all the things in his nature were like this.Admit that they cannot be separated from it under any circumstances. These are its natural affairs and the fact that Islam is a natural religion means that all its beliefs, all its teachings, all its rules are in accordance with all human nature.And there is no command that completely negates the natural requirements of man.On the contrary, there is a complete concession of human nature in all its rules.For example, it is a natural instinct of man to feel hungry, thirsty, he naturally wants to be with others, and it is his natural instinct to live in harmony with the family system.He took into account his natural needs and did not give any order that would completely suppress his natural needs.Christianity, on the other hand, describes "monasticism" as a source of nearness to God, which means that unless the wife leaves the children, the house, the bar, and the business, she goes into the wilderness.Man's pleasure cannot be obtained. Man cannot obey this command unless he completely suppresses his natural desires.Islam has not given any such order.* Question: * Maulana!But the nature of modern man seems to deviate from many of the rules of Islam.Answer: I want to make it clear and I have not fulfilled my point yet that nature cannot change with the change of time. You cannot say about anything that it was human nature in the past.But not today.Because the demand of human nature which changes with the passage of time cannot be its natural requirement.In fact, there are two kinds of misconceptions which make man feel that nature has changed. Sometimes he misunderstands the meaning of nature and declares some of his habits to be nature, although there is a big difference between habit and nature.Sometimes the natural instinct of man is the same, but when man is badly affected by his environment or by the constant (continuous) action against nature, his instinct is overwhelmed and he gets the misconception thatThat is not a requirement of nature.Therefore, it is stated in the hadith that when every child is born, he is born on the basis of religion, but his parents (ie the environment) make him a Jew, a Christian or a Magian.Think of it as if a human being is born, left in a forest, and if he learns the habits of animals and adopts the same methods, he will hate humans and become accustomed to animals, and in history such human beingsThere are examples of them becoming so accustomed to wildlife that they ran away from humans and their settlements.Obviously, on the basis of this, it cannot be said that their nature changed and their love for animals became their nature instead of forest and human beings instead of settlement, but in fact their nature as human beings is still the same.The constant effects of the environment overwhelmed nature.Take another example!It is human nature to sleep at night and wake up early in the morning, so you may have seen newborns wake up early in the morning without any training.But if the habit from the environment is against it, then gradually their habit changes and the natural instinct is overwhelmed, they also start getting up late.* Question: * Maulana!One question here may be that if a person's body condition is such that he sleeps at two o'clock at night and wakes up at eight o'clock in the afternoon, then his prayers will inevitably be missed during this process. What should he do?* Answer: * This question is a bit irrelevant and I do not think that a person's body condition can be like this permanently, yes, if he is disabled due to some illness, etc.If you can get up, as long as this disability remains, the rule of Islam is that whenever you wake up, pray at the same time, but in all cases make it a habit to get up early.* Question: * But Maulana's question was that it was the nature of a person to get up late and then it was not against nature to order him to wake up early?* Answer: * Here again you are confusing "nature" and "habit". Let me clarify it differently.Nature refers to the requirements of man which entered into its nature as a human race, these requirements are the same in all human beings and do not change.There is another thing called habit and what you call Habit in English can be different for different people and it is possible to change it and Islam has never claimed that it will be according to every habit of every human being.Therefore, a person who is accustomed to getting up late, if he is doing so due to some unavoidable compulsion, then his habit is against human nature which should be changed.* Question: * Maulana!This is understandable, but now a question arises that when Islam is a natural religion, why is it difficult to follow some of its rules?* Answer: * Look!It is not necessary for a natural work to have the slightest difficulty.For example, earning is also a requirement of human nature to get one's material needs, but to get this material need, one has to work hard, one has to work hard.So because of this pain and hardship, it will not be said that this action is against nature, so what is in accordance with nature, sometimes it takes some hard work and effort to achieve it, then it is relevant to practice it.There is also a problem. This problem is not against nature. Yes, a problem which is unbearable for man and which man cannot adopt is beyond his power. If there is such a problem, it will be said that it is against his nature.If there is a problem, then such a problem is not seen in Islam.The rules that Islam has given will sometimes have a little bit of pain, a little bit of hard work and hardship.But that labor is a part of nature itself, and if this labor is removed from man's nature, then man will be nothing.However, hard work is not unbearable and it becomes easier with a little attention and habit. Besides, it is in the nature of man to make mistakes, so Islam has made it a rule that when a mistake is made, repent, there will be no arrest.* Question: * There is one thing Maulana Sahib!If you researched what you learned and practiced it yourself, you would test Islam in terms of the natural religion.If your natural requirements are put in front and all other religions are put in front, then the things that are in accordance with your nature are not found in other religions. If they are found, then they also became natural religions.* Answer: * This is a very good question you asked.In fact, being a natural religion means that I have already told you that there is no such thing as a command, no such thing as a belief that contradicts the natural requirements of man and eliminates the natural requirements of man.Now suppose that a religion is adopted which has some rules which are in accordance with human nature but some rules which are against human nature then this religion will not be called natural for exampleChristianity has many of its precepts that are in accordance with human nature.We do not say that every command of it is against the nature of man, but there are some commandments which are against the nature, for example, as long as you are cut off from the world, go and sit in the forest, stop earning food, adopt monasticism.Without it, one cannot attain nearness to God.So it is against human nature.Christianity is still incomplete anyway.Because he has to visit for the second time, so it is not completed yet?* Answer: * Besides, it is a natural human right that what he believes in should not be against reason, but Christianity, you see, his most basic belief is that it is one of three.How can three and one be one with intellect? If three is three and one is one, then they do not answer that it is an absolute secret. It is a divine secret. There is no room for us to think in it. The door of intellect is there.Closed I do not say that man can be guided by reason in every matter of his life.I strongly disagree that every human being can be guided by reason in all matters, but that it is his natural right to have the basic beliefs on which the foundation of his life rests.Let him understand it with his intellect and prove it according to his intellect.* Question: * One thing is that Maulana Sahib Aap said that the guidance of the intellect is not necessary to be found in every matter, if the guidance of the intellect can not be found, then it is known that it is an unnatural thing.Because reason and nature, I think, are both necessary and obligatory.* Answer: * No, this is a very good question. I will explain it in a little detail and it needs to be understood a little bit and with a very cold heart that both intellect and nature are not one. There is a difference between heaven and earth.Rather, human nature wants him not to follow reason in every matter and not to follow reason in every matter. You hardly know this.But let me explain.Look at all the different sources of knowledge they have.For example, the source of knowledge in this khumsa is the five senses, the eye, the ear, the nose, the hand, etc. By this we know by seeing with the eye, hearing from the ear, sniffing through the nose and touching with the hand.The senses are a specific sphere of khumsa and each of them has a distributor.And everyone's work is different.The eye can see and cannot hear.The ear can hear and cannot see.Can touch hands but can't walk with it.So there are specific spheres of the senses within which they operate.They do not work outside of this circle.Then there is a circle of these five senses that going beyond that will not work. For example, now I can see from the eye to the wall. These five senses cannot work across the wall.But beyond these five senses, we were given a source of knowledge.And that is the intellect that when we see this door, our intellect must guide us that there is a place on this side of the wall, there is land, there is a room, there is a courtyard, although we cannot know that thing with our senses.So where the circle of five senses ends, the circle of intellect begins.* Question: * No Maulana Sahib!Listen, you just said that we don't need intellect to understand anything.Answer: No, I did not say that.Let me clarify my point, then you say that I did not say that man does not need intellect to understand.Nor did I say that the senses of khumsa are not one of them. I would like to say that the knowledge that a person acquires is not only obtained from the senses khumsa but also from the intellect.All the knowledge I have will be based on reason.So it is also wrong for a person to claim that whatever knowledge I have, I will get only on the basis of five senses.So this is also wrong, but man has different sources of knowledge.One of the sources of the senses is khumsa. Some things we get from the senses khumsa but these senses are a limited range of things that we get from khumsa within which they guide us.And give us knowledge.Going beyond this realm, the senses do not work for us. There we need intellect.Where the senses end, we need intellect.And we know many things by reason.If the senses cannot know with the khumsa, then the intellect works in the place where the senses leave the khumsa working, but now if you want to know the things of the senses with the khumsa, it cannot happen.* Question: * Couldn't it be clear?* Answer: * For example, let me tell you!This is the syrup, this is the red color. When we got this knowledge, we got the knowledge of the title of the syrup through our eyes.Now if a person says close your eyes and now tell the intellect that its color is red or green, close your eyes and just want to know its color with the intellect, then it can never be known.So it became clear that the knowledge of everything cannot be obtained from the intellect, but the closest source is the senses, after which the second source is the intellect.Where there is a contradiction between the intellect and the senses that the senses are saying one thing and the intellect is saying another thing, then what will you do?* Question: * This is an unnatural process.* Answer: * So obviously the conclusion drawn by the intellect is not correct because the five senses are giving knowledge.It is more certain that where there is a difference of opinion among the people that one person came up with one result and the other came up with another result, then the result which the senses will now support khumsa will be accepted.And whoever is opposed to it will be rejected, but just as the guidance of the senses is limited, so is the guidance of the intellect so limited that it also stops at one place.And its circle ends.There begins the circle of revelation, that is, of guidance given by God Almighty.What is given by the Prophets is that the circle that starts from where the flight of the intellect ends and the flight of the intellect ends means that we do not understand this thing on the basis of the intellect alone.CanIt is told to us by revelation.* Question: * If that command is clear on the basis of reason, but the command of revelation is completely opposite to it.What will you do then?* Answer: * It will not be a revelation but something else will happen as I said that if the senses are saying intellect against khumsa then you will leave the intellect.They will say that this is not a requirement of intellect.Invalid result.In the same way, if someone presents something in the name of revelation that is against the intellect, then because it is against the intellect, it will be said that it is a revelation and not something else, as I have just said before.And a three is like a mystery to say that three is considered as one and one is considered as three is against open intellect. No intellect can accept it.Therefore, if someone says that it is a revelation, he is wrong.But remember one thing and that is that revelation cannot be against the intellect but can contain things that are beyond the flight of the intellect. There is a difference between the two things.One is to be against reason and one is beyond reason.In fact, confusing the two leads to a great misunderstanding. It would be contrary to reason to say that its existence would necessitate a rational solution, and reason would argue that it is invalid.It is called Impossible in English and it is one. There is no argument to invalidate it, but there is no argument to prove it and its precedent.Can't find it, so it feels strange and strange, which you can call Improbable, because the intellect does not experience it.Therefore, he knows it strangely, so he does not have the means to prove it, so there is a big difference between Impossible and Improbable.Now it happens that nothing can be said by revelation that is Impossible, that is, contrary to the argument of reason, but it may be that revelation is something that is Improbable, that is, above the flight of reason, and that is exactly.It is natural, as I said, that the circle of the intellect begins after the circle of the senses khumsa.And its scope cannot reach there, it cannot reach there with intellect and revelation gives its knowledge, although it sometimes seems strange, sometimes it seems wonderful and sometimes it seems strange.For example, revelation tells us that there is a sky above. Now our senses do not see the sky and the intellect does not reach it. What we see is not the sky.Obviously, this is the limit of sight that we see in blue, so many current scientists say that there is no sky at all. Those who say that the sky does not exist, it does not mean that there is no sky.Is there any evidence for the existence of God, that is, they have found the evidence on the basis of which it has not been proved, or that they have established any evidence for its negation, if it does not happen?And people say, "Sir, we do not see, nor do we see with our eyes, nor does our intellect say that it is necessary for the sky to be, but at the same time, from the point of view of intellect, they cannot establish any argument thatBased on this, it can be said that the sky cannot exist, it is not possible and the existence of the sky is impossible, the sky does not exist.Yes, our approach cannot be there, there may be an approach later. If there is such a thing here, then it is something beyond the senses or the intellect, but the intellect does not present any evidence for its non-existence.
