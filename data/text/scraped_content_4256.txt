Title: Unrequited Love Content: Unrequited love, where the partner isn't able to obtain or 'win' the person that is the object of affection, may be  a way to ensure that one doesn't face the reality of a relationship.Real relationships have difficult, heavy demands on a person, and being in love while not being able to attain the love, insulates us from the other post-love problems.
Title: The Fear Of Love Content: Fear of Love may be due to a self-hatred, or a fear that others may know our true feelings, dissolving our ego-state, which may have been delicately carved over the years.
Title: How To Unfixate Content: To un-fixate from an object of one's affection, you have to tell yourself that you never really liked the person, and the qualities you liked in them, can be found in others.By dissecting and investigating the character, you can help isolate the traits you liked, and can eventually find them in other people.
