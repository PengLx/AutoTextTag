Title: Intuitive eating Content: Rejects the diet mentality, promotes giving yourself permission to eat without labeling some foods "good” and others “bad,” acknowledging when you’re eating your feelings and accepting the body you have.
Title: Making peace with food Content: It doesn’t mean giving in to every craving; it means getting rid of the idea of “giving in” to “bad foods” altogether. Eat that Oreo when you want it, without any negative emotion attached, and you won’t feel like you need to eat the whole bag.
Title: Respect your fullness Content: Listen for the body signals that tell you that you are no longer hungry. Intuitive eating is about understanding what foods your body feels best eating, and how to make your own food choices based on your own hunger and fullness
Title: Intuitive eating and weight fluctuation Content: Intuitive eating does not guarantee weight loss.Dietitians who work with intuitive eating often talk about the “set point” – the range (sometimes as wide as 10-20 lbs) of weight that your body naturally leans toward over time, whatever you do. Research into this theory is ongoing.
Title: Understanding hunger Content: Intuitive eating means learning the difference between what is eating for emotional need versus physical need, and also really understanding that foods can be emotionally equal. It’s about learning how to challenge your food rules and give yourself permission to eat when you’re hungry.
