Title: Make "power down" time a priority Content: Shut down those activities that stimulate your mind, such as work, emails, internet browsing and even watching TV.Try reading a book, taking a bath, listening to music or practicing some gentle yoga or meditation. Develop rituals that work for you.
Title: Try a brain dump Content: Dump it all out. Write some lists, or simply use the "worry diary" technique and jot down all of the things you’re stressing about.Do this before your "power down" time. This helps your mind let these things go. Once they're written down, you can relax; there's no chance you'll forget them.
Title: Eat, drink and move mindfully Content: If you’re experiencing sleeping problems:Cut back on caffeine (particularly after midday).Avoid eating a particularly heavy meal late in the evening.Meditation and supplements can also affect sleep so it’s best to get educated about what you’re taking.Intense exercise late at night isn't recommended.
Title: Create the right environment for sleep Content: Ensuring your bedroom is sufficiently dark enough, quiet enough and well ventilated to allow for good sleep.You might discover that your stress levels increase according to how much mess is in your personal space.
Title: Keep a sleep schedule Content: Aim to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.If you’re experiencing sleeping difficulties it’s also a good idea to keep a record of exactly when you do get to bed, how often (and for how long) you wake during the night and what time you get up.This information will be helpful for your clinician if you decide to visit your GP or a psychologist for help with sleeping.
