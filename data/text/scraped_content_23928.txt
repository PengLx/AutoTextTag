Title: The Three Phases Of Life Transitions Content: In the face of a crisis, we feel chaotic and out of control. The transition comes in three phases:The Long Goodbye, in which we see our old self go.The Messy Middle, where we shed our old habits and embrace new ones.The New Beginning, where we take a ‘rebirth’.
Title: Identifying Emotions During Life Transitions Content: Be aware of your emotions such as fear, sadness and shame. Writing down your feelings or doing certain rituals or activities to cope up with the loss is a great way to transition your life. A ritualistic gesture becomes a statement and a metaphor for your emotions to take a physical form.
Title: The Process Of Letting Go Content: Shedding of something we have long clung to, like a certain mindset, delusion, habit or dream, is part of the messy middle.It clears the unwanted parts of your life, creating space for something new to blossom.
Title: Being Creative During Life Setbacks Content: Responding with creativity makes us handle the ‘lifequake’ with ease. Writing poetry/prose, cooking, painting or dancing makes us talk to our inner butterfly that is now ready to sprout the wings of growth.
Title: Rewriting Your Life Story Content: We all crave for meaning and fulfilment in our lives. A crisis provides us with a way to rewrite our life story and become something we always wanted. Almost all the great successful people recall the ‘lifequakes’ they have had in their lives that shaped them, while they stand on the podium to collect an award or a recognition.
