Title: Melancholic depression Content: Melancholic depression, as described by Hippocrates, was considered a unique condition that struck people out of the blue. It is now known as "endogenous depression" (coming from within) and different from depression in response to external stressors.In 1980, depressive disorders were remodeled as a single entity that only varies by degrees of severity.
Title: Sadness and depression Content: The extension of "clinical depression" to include sadness created concern. Everyone feels down or sad sometimes, and usually, these moods pass without long-term consequences. Clinical depression is more severe, such as losing sleep or thinking life isn't worth living and extends for a longer period. Lumping them together and ignoring the differing causes may lead to an inappropriate therapeutic approach. This model also treats melancholia as a major depression "specifier" and not as a disorder in its own right.
Title: Melancholia: A distinct pattern Content: Melancholia shows a clear pattern of symptoms and signs. Sufferers experience a gloominess and have no desire to socialize. They also lack energy and have difficulty concentrating. Episodes typically appear from nowhere.
Title: Melancholia: Physical underpinnings Content: Individuals suffering from melancholia report a family history of "depression," bipolar disorder, or suicide. Melancholy is biologically underpinned rather than caused by external stressors or psychological factors, such as personality type.Treatment consists of antidepressant drugs and electroconvulsive therapy (which is rarely needed.)
