Title: Do some math Content: You make one decision, wait, make a second decision, and then make a compromise between the two.Averaging the two judgments tends to outperform trying to identify the better of the two, because answers based on different pools of evidence often bracket with the truth, and because people are imperfect at guessing which answer is better
Title: Pair a good decision with a bad one Content: If you only allow yourself your vice while you’re simultaneously being virtuous, you’ll spend more time doing things that are good for you and less time doing the “bad” things.The researchers call this “pre-bundling” and say it allows people to couple instantly gratifying activities (such as watching trashy TV) with a behavior that’s beneficial in the long term but requires willpower (like working out).
Title: Take things one at a time Content: Next time you’re faced with a problem with many possible answers, pinpoint your end goals and then come up with a solution for each.This is likely to lead to the generation of a diverse set of options covering multiple categories of solutions.
