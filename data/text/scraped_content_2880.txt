Title: The rational manner Content: When faced with a difficult dilemma, we should carefully assess our options and spend a few moments consciously deliberating the information. Then, we should choose the best fit for our preferences.
Title: The emotional system Content: It's only in the last few years that researchers have demonstrated that the emotional systemmight excel at complex decisions, or those involving lots of variables.This would suggest that the unconscious is better suited for difficult cognitive tasks than the conscious brain, that the very thought process we've long disregarded as irrational and impulsive might actually be "smarter" than reasoned deliberation.
Title: How emotional decision-making works Content: Thinking in a rational manner is more effective when there are limited pieces of information.However, those focused on feelings prove far better incomplex conditions.The advantages of emotional decision-making could be undone by a subsequent bout of deliberation, which suggests that we shouldn't doubt a particularly strong instinct, at least when considering lots of information.
Title: How to make hard decisions Content: Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision.But don't try to analyze the information with your conscious mind.Instead, go on holiday while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuition then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best choice.
