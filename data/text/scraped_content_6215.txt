Title: Check-in with people Content: If you think about the current situation too much, you might start freaking out from the pressure.What makes this situation survivable is checking in with each other. Doing so can ease the stigma someone might feel for admitting that they’re having a hard time, and it creates cohesion.
Title: Assume good intentions Content: Trust in the other and assume good intent. Even if they annoy you or do something you disagree with, know that they’re doing their best.Pause, breathe and consider how the other is feeling. By doing this, you can alleviate any blowups.
Title: Think, then act Content: In a stressful situation, when people often fall back on instinct, deliberate action is indispensable.So think of your life in terms of a series of "think/do think/do, think/do".It’s the absence of the "think" in the "think/do" sequence that gets people in trouble.
Title: Find your quiet place Content: When you’re trying to balance work and childcare, while also maintaining your relationship with your partner while in isolation, sleep is usually a low priority. But that's when being rested is important.When everything feels overwhelming, hit pause, find a quiet place and sleep.
Title: The 100-zero rule Content: Either give somebody 100% of your attention or zero.If you’re half paying attention to your kid or your partner while doing something else, you are failing at paying attention to them and at whatever else you were trying to do.
Title: The circle of control Content: Overthinking about all that could go wrong with the world because of the pandemic is not really helping you.Focus on what you can control: washing hands, connecting, following rules to stay apart, not touching your face. Keep your mind busy with other positive activities: like reading or learning something new.
