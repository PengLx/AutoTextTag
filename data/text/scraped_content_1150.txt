Title: Thomas Hobbes explained Content: Hobbes, an English philosopher, believes mankind's nature to be solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short as described in his book, The Leviathan.This is why people adhere to social contracts (ceding some rights in return for protection from a governing body) in order to avoid a crippling struggle.
Title: Moral issues Content: The 'Show, don't tell' rule is especially pertinent when it comes to immoral acts.Until a book becomes moving pictures, any moral issue with it doesn't seem to reach national press levels, because it shows these contentious issues to a wider audience.If you show the act, but don't tell anyone what to think about it, the fact that an author or film-maker hasn't clanged down a big sign saying 'And this is bad' is tantamount to advocation.
Title: GoT's similarities with the Leviathan Content: A Song of Ice and Fire might very well deliberately echo Leviathan.The notion that, without protection from the Iron Throne, the land falls into an every-man-for-himself struggle does echo the ideas laid down in Leviathan.
Title: Subtext Content: From a purely technical point-of-view, a subtext is good. From a moral point-of-view, it depends on what that subtext is.
Title: Philosophical Theory or just Entertainment Content: Advocating a philosophical theory is not something that is going to drastically alter many people's lives.Your subtext can be as clever or as repulsive as you want, because most people just want to be entertained.
