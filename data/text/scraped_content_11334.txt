Title: Make believe it is time to go to bed Content: If you find yourself experiencing issues when trying to fall asleep, you might as well consider making your brain believe that night has come. In order to do this, you could start using dim table or side lamps instead of bright ones, turning on your phone the so-called 'night mode' or using a mask to cover your face.
Title: The so-called 'sleep debt' and how to fight it Content: Whenever we fall behind on sleep, most of us have the tendency to try to catch up during weekends.
