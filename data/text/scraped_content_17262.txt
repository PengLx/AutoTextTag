It all revolves around the way you use it.
Title: Excessive passivity Content: This is the habit of only consuming the information that is brought in front of you, rather than actively cultivating knowledge in areas that are valuable to you.Addressing this problem can be done in a pragmatic way: consider it a habit audit, or an honest look at how you are spending your time.
