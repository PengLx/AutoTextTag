Title: Ramp up slowly Content: If you did 3 short runs in your first week, you shouldn’t double that for week 2, even if you feel fine.Progress takes more time than you think, because each body system adapts to exercise at their own pace - maybe your lungs felt fine on the run, but the next day your muscles felt sore. 
Title: A beginner routine should include: Content: Most or all of your runs at a pace that feels comfortable, controlled, and conversational.Exercise that is not running, if you feel that the above isn’t enough for you: Cycling and other cross-training can work your lungs and muscles without putting too much strain on your tendons and ligaments.Strength training, to help everything get stronger and more adaptable.
Title: The "too-much-too-soon" trap Content: It's usually not the shoes you're wearing, or your posture, but forcing yourself to accomplish too much from the very start that's causing you physical pain.If you started running in the last few weeks or months and you get injured, you probably have nothing to blame but the fact that you’ve been doing too much, too soon.
Title: Know when to stop Content: If you do end up hurting, it helps to know what kind of pain is usually fine to run through vs what needs to be looked at.Runners tend to run through:Muscle soreness,ache that’s uncomfortable but not really painful, discomfort that feels better as you run;Stop running when injuries:Feel like a sharp, stabbing pain, cause you to limp or change your gait, get worse as you run.
