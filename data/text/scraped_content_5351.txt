Title: Getting an early start Content: Plan your morning the night before and stick to your plan.If a new task comes in that isn’t 100% urgent, designate a time that you’ll work on it uninterrupted or try to delegate the problem solving as much as possible until you have time to deal with it.
Title: Deciding where to work Content: If you know you’re more likely to work from home, invest in comfortable furniture; you feel good it will inspire you to get work done.If you want to join a local co-working space but are intimidated by the price point, ask about smaller memberships to start.
Title: Prioritizing tasks Content: Don’t let your skepticism about productivity hacks get in the way of finding a technique that suits you and helps you get things done.If you’re still having a hard time identifying priorities, try working backward by identifying work that’s definitely not a priority. Eliminate those items and assess what’s left.
Title: Scheduling uninterrupted time Content: Use services that block specific sites and apps from your phone or computer for a certain amount of time to help you focus and minimize distractions.
Title: Work-life balance Content: True balance comes from within and is a result of the choices you make.Set firm boundaries for yourself and refuse to waver on them. Make it a habit to unplug at a specific time each evening and incorporate a scheduled “off” day into your week to reset.
