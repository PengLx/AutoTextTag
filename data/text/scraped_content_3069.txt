Title: Be Selective Content: Try tokeep in your closet only pieces that you love and are truly excited to wear. Anything ill-fitting, scratchy, worn-out, barely "good enough, " or that simply doesn't suit your personal style can be discarded.
Title: Create Your Own Unique Look Content: Following rules and blueprints won’t help you cultivate a strong sense of style, because that’s deeply personal. Even if you like many of the same colors, materials, or cuts as someone else, how you combine, choose and style your looks is a reflection of your unique taste and the influences that you have picked up.
Title: High-Quality, Long-Lasting Pieces Content: Once you become more selective about what you keep in your closet, you'll attach a bigger value to each individual piece and will probably no longer be satisfied with cheap, badly manufactured stuff.You'll want clothes that feel good on your skin, and comfortable, sturdy and durable.
Title: Follow Trends That Suit Your Style Content: Fashion should be about celebrating creativity and having fun. You should not feel bad about wearing something if you love it, but you also shouldn't feel bad about wearing what's not in line with what's currently considered to be the look.
Title: Developing Your Style Content: It takes time to train your eye, experiment with different aesthetics, and develop a sense of style that feels natural and effortless to you. And it takes time to then learn how to best utilize those pieces to create outfits that you love.The good news is that, no matter what your wardrobe looks like right now, you can get it back in shape and even have fun doing so.
