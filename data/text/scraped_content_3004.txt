Personal Development
Title: Reframe or divert Content: The first step in approaching a negative situation with an optimistic outlook is to accept what you can’t change.Once you’ve done that, you have 2 options: reframe( look for an opportunity instead of ruminating on the loss ) or divert (shift your focus to something else).
Title: Savor the good Content: Noticing and savoring the pleasant moments and thinking, "Wow, this is really great"can strengthen positive emotions.In general, we tend to dwell on the negative side and not notice the positive things we experience.
Title: Set reminders Content: Write yourself a message on a sticky note and attach it to your computer screen at work (an inspirational quote, a reminder to smile, etc).Small reminders like these help keep positivity front and center in your life.
Title: Do something nice for someone else Content: One of the fastest, most effective ways to feel happier is to show someone kindness.In a 2017 study by Oxford University, researchers found that performing acts of kindness for just seven days had a measurable, positive effect on well-being and positive social emotion.
Title: Phone a friend Content: Most optimists have strong, supportive relationships.The comfort of knowing you don’t have to do everything by yourself contributes to long-term happiness.You don’t have to have a lot of them, but you have to have around you people you trust and trust you back.
Title: Say thanks Content: Thinking about what you’re grateful for can instantly improve your mood.It works because our interpretation of events influences our emotions more than the events themselves.
