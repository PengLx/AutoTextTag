Title: How artists work Content: The work of top creatives follows a consistent pattern and routine:Maya Angelou would rent a local hotel to write, from 6:30 AM until 2 PM. She would never sleep at the hotel.Pulitzer Prize winner Michael Chabon writes five nights per week from 10 PM to 3 AM.Haruki Murakami wakes up at 4 AM, writes for five hours, and then goes for a run.
Title: The power in Scheduling Content: If you’re serious about creating something, stop waiting for motivation and creative inspiration to strike you and simply set a schedule for doing work on a consistent basis.You can’t selectively choose your best moments and only work on the days when you have great ideas. The only way to unveil the great ideas inside of you is to go through a volume of work, put in your repetitions, and show up over and over again.
