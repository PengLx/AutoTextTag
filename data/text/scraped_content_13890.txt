Title: Learn to read self-help books Content: The issue with reading self-help books is that not everybody is willing to apply what is written within the pages of those very books. However, if you are to spend time reading a book, why not trying to understand and follow its advice? One sure way to do this is by the so-called reading technique 'lectio divina' that implies reading really slowly and repeatedly the same text until you actually understand its benefits and why it could change your life for the better. Give it a try and you might just be amazed by the result.
