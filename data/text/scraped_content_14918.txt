Title: The Meaning Of Meaning Content: The concept of meaning, points to objective and subjective modes.Objective: The world or the universe as it exists.Subjective: The ‘I’, the person that exists to experience the universe.Isaac Newton gave visibility to this very fabric of reality, making meaning an action, a synthesis of objectivity and subjectivity, both of which are vital.
Title: Vitality Of Life Content: The architect Christopher Alexander concludes that life is everywhere, in an interconnected way, by design. Nature, animals, plants, mountains, clouds, rivers, valleys, birds and insects just fit together in harmony. Nature’s design is integrated and flawless.
Title: Reality Of Matter Content: If there was no matter and no design, life would have been a blank dream, with no color or flavour.Meaning is found when matter and objects collide with consciousness and subjectivity. The cycles of nature are prime examples of this, showing to us that meaning is the vitality and the action that we fill in matter.
