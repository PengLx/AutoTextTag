Title: Dealing with change Content: We can train to get good at dealing with times of massive change.And here’s a secret: actually,we’re always in times of change. If you’re waiting for things to settle down, it’s a beautiful shift to let go of that and just relax into the groundlessness of it all.
Title: How our mind reacts to change Content: It complains. It doesn’t like change that it didn’t choose.It gets angry at others. It blames and might lash out at them.It looks for comfort, for a return to what you’re used to, what you know, what you’ve always gone to for comfort.It tries to get control. This can be stressful, trying to control the massively uncontrollable.
Title: Shifting the way we respond to stress Content: Notice when you’re feeling stress or resistance about change.Drop into the pure experience of the moment.Open to the wide-open nature of this moment, of reality.Relax into the beauty of the changing moment.Practice compassion, gratitude and joyful appreciation.Practice loving things exactly as they are.
