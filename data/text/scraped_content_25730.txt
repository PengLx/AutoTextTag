Title: Coffee: Health effects of brewing methods Content: There are seemingly infinite formulations of coffee - latte, cold brew, dalgona, flat white, espresso. A recent analysis compared brewing methods and analyzed the health effects.Moderately drinking filtered coffee (or drip coffee) is the healthiest as it resulted in the lowest risk of cardiovascular mortality. It may even boost longevity.Unfiltered coffee is the most dangerous brewing approach because unfiltered coffee contains substances that increase "bad" LDL cholesterol. A filter removes these. Espressos, cappuccinos, Turkish coffee, and coffee made with a French press fall into this category.
Title: Health benefits of filtered coffee Content: According to a study, drinking one to four cups of filtered coffee per day is associated with a 15 percent reduced risk of death from any cause compared to people who don't drink coffee. It could be because coffee is rich in antioxidants, including polyphenols.Unfiltered coffee did not raise the risk of death compared to abstaining from coffee. However, in men aged 60 and above, unfiltered coffee was linked with elevated cardiovascular mortality.
