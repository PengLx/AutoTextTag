Title: Talking Out Loud Content: Talking out loud helps spell out your intentions, and provides clarity.Talking out loud about a problem allows you to better understand the problem, provides a certain detached view of the problem by framing it differently and can help identify possible solutions.

Title: Decision Making and Time Management Content: Self-talking can save us a lot of time by getting us out of our procrastination, and wake us up from our distractions. It makes decisions easier and makes us more committed to getting things done.
Title: What we say to ourselves matters Content: Clearing any self-doubt and removing 'imposter syndrome' from our mind is a huge benefit of self-talking.If you are feeling inadequate, incompetent, or simply in doubt, practicing self-compassion by giving yourself a pep-talk can work wonders.
Title: Self-Management Content: We all want to grow every day, become better problem solvers, make decisions, learn new things and then teach them to others, journal about what's going on in our lives and trying to accomplish our goals. All of this requires self-management.Self-talking as a self-management tool is a proactive approach at our disposal.
