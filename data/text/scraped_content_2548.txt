Title: Busy-ness is glorified Content: “Busy-ness” is glorified in our society. We wear our stress like a badge of honor, as if the busier we are, the more impressive we must be, and the more accomplished we must seem.When we glorify stress and being busy, we normalize a culture where running ourselves ragged is not just celebrated but the norm. To not be busy makes you an outlier — someone that is not measuring up to the "standards.”
Title: Busy-ness is selfish Content: Being so hyper-fixed on our own stress and schedule is, in a way, selfish. It’s a way to be caught up in our own little world. Instead, we should be encouraging ourselves and others to find a better balance in our lives and in our experiences.

But, as soon as we reach that goal, we rarely bask in that success because we must be in pursuit of the next one.Analyze the reasons as to why you are doing the things you do, and why you are reaching for the goals you are trying to achieve.
