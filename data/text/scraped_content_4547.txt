Title: Habits Lead To Success Content: Our habits and routines count towards our success to a greater degree than luck, brains, good decisions and even talent.Habits need not be physical routines, but just the way we think, and the 'self-talk' we do every day.
Title: Say Yes Content: Four basic habits create energy: Sleep, Meditation, Physical Activity and Nutrition.This created energy can be focused on new opportunities that take you out of your comfort zone, and those opportunities are usually hidden in the things we normally say 'No' to.Considering saying 'Yes' can provide us with the high road to success eventually.
Title: Analysis Paralysis Content: Too much analysis and putting our energies into one single thing can be counterproductive.If something is providing us with a good enough result, we need to be satisfied and focus our energies on other things.
Title: Curiosity Content: One of the best habits that contribute to success is to be a constant learner by researching, reading, striking interesting conversations, and just being curious about the world.A good way to implement this is to attend conferences and workshops.
Title: The Hard Stuff Content: Taking on the challenging and difficult things at the beginning of the day is a powerful habit.Good habits may be small but having a daily routine gives compound interest, triggering a series of other powerful habits.Even a small habit can be an entry point to set your day into action.
