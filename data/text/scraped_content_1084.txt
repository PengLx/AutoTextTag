Title: Breathing in meditation practices Content: The many benefits of meditation might be well documented, but the breathing exercises associated with mediation might be what's actually doing all the good work to your body and your mind.How you breathe has a direct effect on your heart rate, which in turn can influence every major system in your body in a sort-of sad chain reaction.
Title: Breathing right Content: Simply breathing at a 1:2 ratio of inhale time to exhale time can substantially change your heart rate, and thus your mood.Try exhaling for twice as long as you inhale, and now concentrate on repeating that length of exhale for, say, fifteen to thirty seconds. You'll notice your heart rate slow immediately.If you need a mantra to repeat to stay in the zone, try a phrase with 4 or 5 syllables.
