Title: Calming an anxious mind with pen and paper Content: All you need are two pieces of paper, something to write with, and a timer:At the top of page 1 write, “What I’m grateful for" and on top of page 2, “What I’m anxious about.” For 7 seconds, focus on what you’re anxious about.Shift your focus to what you’re grateful, for 17 seconds (the brain is very quick to feel anxious, and takes longer to experience gratitude).Do 2 more sets, taking a few deep breaths between them. Most people find that by the third round, they experience less anxiety.
Title: Consciously shifting your focus Content: By consciously shifting from anxiety to gratitude, you’re reminding your brain who’s in charge.You decide what thoughts to focus on, even when the news reports and panicked interactions with your peers would normally cause your mind to spiral.
