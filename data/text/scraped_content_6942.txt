Yes, there are other important things you have to take into consideration, but keeping your eyes your work signals that you are committed to getting your work done no matter what.You can wear whatever you want, you can work from the couch, you can work at 2 AM or 6 PM, using any type of app you like. 
Title: Don’t overdo it Content: If you start making mistakes and you feel dizzy after working a certain number of hours, don't overdo it.This is a sensitive topic if you have a boss, but observe the number of hours you are functioning the best. If you have 7 hours of productive work in you per day, use them. But if your battery runs out after 5 hours, call it a day.
Title: Productivity strategies Content: Experiment with them and find which one better suits you.Create your own system for working from home. What works for other people might not work for you.
