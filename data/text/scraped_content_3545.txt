Title: Laziness Content: We are considered lazy if we ought to do something but are unwilling to do it.Today, laziness is so closely connected with poverty and failure that a poor person is often presumed lazy, no matter how hard he or she actually works.
Title: Why We're Lazy Content: Few people would choose to be lazy.Many 'lazy' people haven't yet found what they want to do or are unable to do it.Some people have become so specialized that they no longer grasp their purpose, and could fall into the trap of not bothering.Some people sabotage themselves by never trying because they fear success or they fear failure.There are also those that feel so hopeless that they cannot begin to think through it.
Title: Idleness and Laziness Content: Idleness, or to be doing nothing, is not the same as laziness. Idleness can amount to laziness, but can also be a clever way of accomplishing tasks.Idleness can be used to observe life, gather inspiration, gain perspective or to maintain health for important tasks. Sometimes the best way of using time is to waste it.
Title: The right balance Content: We dream of being idle but simultaneously feel that we want to do something.Strategic idleness is an art and difficult to manage. We fear boredom that might come with idleness. Boredom points to the meaninglessness of life and provokes uncomfortable thoughts and feelings that we would like to avoid. We would rather fill that void with being busy.Yet, we would be in a better place if we spend some time doing nothing.
