Title: The root cause of bad writing Content: The root cause of bad writing is struggling to imagine what it is like for someone else not to know something that you know.  Whenever writing is loaded with jargon, clich√©s, technical terms, and abbreviations, two questions come to mind:What is the writer is trying to say?How can the writer state those ideas more clearly without using confusing language?
Title: Why we write badly Content: When we become good at our job or hobby, we use catchwords to shorten long-winded descriptions that we have become very familiar with.The problem is that these catchwords become automatic. While we think these words would facilitate our communication, we forget that our readers may not understand the concepts behind these shortened words.
Title: How to write clearer Content: A considerate writer will add a few words of explanation to common technical terms, such as Arabidopsis, a flowering mustard plant.Readers will appreciate many examples when you explain an idea..If you write a sentence that makes you pause and think about what it means, assume your readers might react the same way.Before publishing your writing, take a few moments to ensure that what you write is clear and understandable.
