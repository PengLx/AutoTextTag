Title: Be careful with eye contact Content: When you are doing the speaking, you should look the person you're talking to directly in the eyes, but not so much when you're the person listening.Making eye contact while your interlocutor is speaking actually harms your perceived competence.
Title: Resist the urge to look at your phone Content: You cannot be present and involved in a conversation if you occasionally look at your phone.Whether you intend to or not, you're sending the message that the people you're talking with aren't as important as whatever text, snap or post is on your device.
Title:  Put your phone out of your reach Content: Phones are altering the fabric of social life.It's because researchers have found that people with access to their smartphone smile less at strangers, compared with those without devices.
Title: Voice tone and social status Content: People alter their tone of voice depending on social status. We adjust our voices depending on the persons we are talking to.In essence, people change their tone of voice when in an anxiety-inducing context, without even being aware of it. And just like body posture, the language we use, or our facial shape and expressions, our voices are part of the arsenal of signals that affect perceptions ofsocial status.
