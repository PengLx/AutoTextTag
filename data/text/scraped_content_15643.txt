Title: Take It Or Leave It Content: The soft ultimatum tactic of the words ‘take it or leave it’ creates a false closure, benefiting the negotiators. They apply this method to falsely limit your options, by only giving you two, whereas there are a lot more.
Title: The Choice Mindset Content: Rather than getting influenced by the limited set of options provided to you by the other party (which tricks you into a vortex of limited options), it is better to adopt a choice mindset. One has to let go of the internal limitation of having no choice (which is an illusion, of course). There is always a choice, there is always an option.Taken to an extreme, this illusion is what triggers suicides, as our limiting mind feels that there is no choice except ending one’s own life, which is entirely false.
Title: Ignore The Ultimatum Content: Thinking about choices makes us ignore the false ultimatums provided by the other party. Have the inner confidence to believe that there is still room for negotiation to get what you want, instead of being lulled into thinking that you have to compromise.
