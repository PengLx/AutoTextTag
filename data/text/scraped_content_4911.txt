Title: Easy and Convenient Content: Online learning gives us a choice and is a flexible virtual approach to learning, but it is not easier or faster, and one still has to learn. It is convenient due to zero commute time, no parking hassles and savings in daily expenses, but it still requires time and effort. It requires more discipline and good study habits, along with enthusiasm and time management skills.
Title: Online Vs Physical Books Content: Are online books as good as physical books in terms of reading?Reading on paper (physical books) is slightly better than online, but it comes down to personal preferences. In most cases, students have a choice.
Title: The Cost Disparity Content: Online course development is a relatively new learning technique, and regular brick and mortar universities did not traditionally have any resources allocated in their operating budget.Over time, this cost disparity may fade away as online learning becomes a regular part of the budget, and initial capital costs are normalized.
Title: Employer Bias Content: Some companies have a bias against online degrees, to some extent, but it should diminish as more individuals with online degrees enter the job market, with hiring managers more exposed to and aligned towards online learning themselves.Online degrees are in no way lesser than regular degrees, and people who are already working do not even have an option to take a regular degree.
Title: Learning Quality Content: When considering online education, you might wonder about the quality of online programs.Is the quality of learning the same on-campus and online?If the course is designed properly, learning occurs equally well in both online and campus delivery methods.
