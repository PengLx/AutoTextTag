Title: Reason and emotions in decision making Content: Decision making is a complex process, that engages both reasoning and emotions. Even the most emotional person uses rational thought when deciding, and even the most rational person is affected by emotions when making decisions.Still, we often tend to highlight the negative role of emotions in decision making.
Title: Being entirely rational Content: It may seem like life would be easier this way, but evolution has supported the development of feeling and thinking exactly because we need them both.Feelings handle our desires and needs now (immediate decisions when danger is imminent), while rationality is preserving our interests and wellbeing in the future (we would lose interest in anything that doesnâ€™t provide us with instant pleasure without it).
Title: Feelings and reason are better friends than we believe Content: They feed and reinforce one another. The best rational decisions take feelings into account.If you want to go on a diet for example, the best option is not always picking the one with the smallest calorie intake, but the one that you like the most and can stick with.
