Title: The meaning machine Content: The human brain is a “meaning machine,” and it will make sense out of literally anything put in front of it.
Title: Figuring out what we want Content: Confirmation bias plays a big role in this process:once we make a selection, we’ll do almost anything to rationalize it. Which is why action will always trump analysis.
Title: Abstract expectations Content: They are the opposite of the real and actual here-and-now. The problem with them is that when we fail to reach the future we had pictured in our heads, we facefeelings of disappointment, inadequacy, and anger.And then we start to look for help from others on how to asses our lives (mostly from self-help gurus and writers).
Title: Happiness isn’t in achieving fantasies  Content: What will bring us the satisfaction and satiation we crave is, rather, abandoning our fantasies and misconceptions of what will bring us happiness.
