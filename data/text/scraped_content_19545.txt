Title: What Home Feels Like Content: We often confuse the structural, physical entity that is the house as home. It may be the body of the home, and just like we relate to our body, the home relates to the house structure.Home is when it is lived, filled with life, with the smell of cooking, or when children are busy playing in the lawn.
Title: Home Is A Soul Content: Just as we are extremely lucky if we get one great love in our lives, we should consider ourselves lucky if we get a real home. The abstract concept of a home is almost supernatural, with the house being the architecture, providing shelter. Great architecture is like the external beauty of a person, which may or may not be corresponding to what the person really is from inside.Nevertheless, the outside is what provides a lust, a longing to see whatâ€™s inside.
Title: Architecture Is Fascinating Content: Architects are creators in the real sense. They can conceptualize and implement great design and arouse deep feelings just by the work they do. Their work is a siren call for many, both romantic and high in status.
Title: The Illusion Of A Castle Content: A house can protect us but can also enslave us, as many war stories in history have shown. The mortgage can chain us into a submissive life, turning the house into a liability.A house is a mirror to ourselves and can be a showplace and a hiding place at the same time.Homes are situated in our minds and dreams, having no physical location in any real sense.
