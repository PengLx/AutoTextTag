Title: Keeping Your Brain Healthy Content: We can improve every aspect of our lives by keeping our most vital organ, our brain, healthy.Exercise is not only good for your body but helps your brain by enhancing many brain structures and functions like the emotion regulating amygdala, and also the prefrontal cortex.
Title: Tea and Brain Health Content: Drinking tea is good for the brain, helping regulate the age-related decline. It also strengthens the brain connections, the neural network inside the brain, making information processing more efficient.Even coffee is said to be good to ward off the onset of Alzheimer’s disease.
Title: Better Heart = Better Brain Content: Anything that is bad for the heart is bad for the brain, including smoking cigarettes, or having a sedentary lifestyle, or having diabetes.Your blood sugar, body mass index, diet and blood pressure all contribute to the health of your heart, and your brain.
Title: Forget Useless Information Content: We consume a lot of disposable information every day. Reading the news, or social media, makes our brains overloaded with irrelevant stuff we don’t need.This also includes past memories that are no longer serving us. Too much information clouds your judgement and decision making.
Title: Drinking A Bit Content: Consuming low levels of alcohol is associated with a lesser risk of dementia. The key is ‘low dose’. Heavy drinking leads to cognitive decline.If your alcohol intake is well within limits and occasional, it will improve overall brain health.
Title: Walk For Your Brain Health Content: Running, jogging and aerobic exercises also help the brain. If you can’t take out time to exercise, a simple walk will do.Exercise is far better for the brain than sitting and solving brain games, which, according to new research, doesn’t help as much as previously thought.
