Title: Habits or Skills Content: Decidewhether what you're trying to improve is mostly a habit or mostly a skill: if your main problem is with doing something you already know how to do, but doing it consistently, that’s probably a habit. If your main problem is not knowing how to do something well enough, that’s probably a skill.
Title: Improving a habit Content: This process has 3 main parts:Define the habit you want to form clearly and consistently;Condition it until it is relatively easy to maintain.Maintain the habit by monitoring it. If you slip, push to reassert the habit quickly.
Title: Improving skills Content: The best strategy for getting better at skills is deliberate practice. A good way to work on this is to divide it into 3:Practice the skill.Get timely feedback on how well you’re performing.Focus on your weak points with selective drills and constrained practice.
