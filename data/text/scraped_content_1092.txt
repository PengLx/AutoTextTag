Title: Misconceptions About Zombies Content: A zombie is a walking corpse, a living dead. But not all walking corpse is a zombie.Unlike many other undead,the zombie is mindless, vacant, without purpose.The zombie was literally enslaved by magic to perform hard labor. Thus, it is a slave to its insatiable appetite, mindlessly consuming without need. It is a slave that was created by that which enslaves it.
Title: How Zombies are Reflected in Life Content: A lot of people have related zombies to the lives of humans, mostly social ills, including consumerism, racism, capitalism, and terrorism.Most of the films about zombies are not about the zombies themselves, but on how people cope or with the reality of the undead.
Title: Samsara = Life of a Zombie Content: Samsara is a belief in Buddhism meaning the cycle of birth, life, death and rebirth. It is new life, but it is still full of suffering. As long as we are alive, suffering is present because it is natural for us to wish for good things not to end even though we knew that it would.Just like the zombie which suffers because of its endless hunger, never satisfied and moves on to another prey which also ends up as a zombie.
Title: Zombies illustrate our own ignorance Content: If we realized and came to grips with the impermanence of all things, it would make no sense to become attached to them.Ignorance of the impermanence of all things, especially our own life, leads to craving happiness through things that will all come to an end. Thus, we are like zombies stumbling mindlessly through life, denying our mortality, striving for fulfillment, finding what we achieve unsatisfying, and seeking more.
