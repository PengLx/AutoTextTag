Title: Why We Use Jargon Content: Jargon is used by people to convey certain information in a shortened way and is irritating to hear for some. It conveys a tone of pride and is exclusionary by default.Studies about using jargons reveal that people with this behavioural trait are insecure or are usually from lower-status institutions.
Title: Unnecessary Jargon: A Major Turn-Off Content: Research shows that the business world, especially venture capitalists, investors and knowledgeable insiders, are unimpressed by unnecessary jargon, and can even form a negative perception towards new technologies. Doctors using medical jargon are often uncommunicative to the patient.Even experts agree that certain key terms in jargon can mean different things to different people, making the whole exercise useless.
Title: The Good Side Of Jargon Content: Jargon is sometimes useful as it makes information concise and clear, at least to the experts. It also helps objectify the problem and create a certain distance, helping in situations (like in the medical field) where emotions may be detrimental to the situation.Jargons help in forming ‘code words’ which are understood by the inner circle, and create bonds between fellow workers in the same domain.
