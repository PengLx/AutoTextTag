Title: Share your agenda Content: Don't assume people will automatically respect the fact that while you're working from home, you're still working.Be proactive, share your schedule and explain when you'll be working. Describe how you work best: Whether that's "interrupt me at will" (probably not) or "only interrupt me if it's truly an emergency" (more likely).
Title: Spend money where it counts most Content: Invest in a good computer, a good phone,and the most comfortable and ergonomically correct chair you can find.Working from home means you spend a lot of time sitting. Whenyou'reuncomfortable, it's hard tostay focused andproductive. See these things as investments, not expenses.
Title: Split your work day into chunks Content: Instead of thinking an 8-, 6-, or 10-hour workday, split your day into four or five 90-minute windows.That way, you will have on average 4 tasks you will get done a lot more efficiently. Take breaks between tasks to recharge.
Title: Embracing a routine Content: Take advantage of the fact a structure is not imposed on you when working from home and choose a routine that makes you as productive as you can be.Otherwise, you'll fritter away much of your day bouncing from task to task and mistaking things that seem urgent for things that are truly important.
Title: Nighttime routines Content: Prepare for that first thing you are going to do in the morning, that sets the tone for the day, thenight before.Make a list. Make a few notes. Review information. Prime yourself to hit the ground at an all-out sprint the next day. A body in super-fast motion tends to stay in super-fast motion.
