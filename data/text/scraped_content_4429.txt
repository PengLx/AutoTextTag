Title: Don't take credit Content: Bad leaders take credit for the good things and pin any blame for bad things to others.Good leaders let the credit go to the team and team members. They only call attention to themselves when they take responsibility for a problem.
Title: Don't call attention to yourself Content: Your task is to help your team and team members do good work. You should understand that the mission is important, not you.As a leader, you’re just there to make things work better.
Title: Your coaching style Content: Coaching should be your primary tool in leading. If your coaching sessions seem more like you’re the therapist and your team member the patient, you’re doing it wrong.Your team members should pay attention to how it will be different in the future.
