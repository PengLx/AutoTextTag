Title: The Power Of Simplicity Content: Pop songs, corporate logos and visual arts tend to go towards a ‘simpler’ direction as compared to earlier decades, as people tend to like simplicity and believe that it may be the ultimate sophistication.Life, on the other hand, is complex and almost always in flux, and according to new research, simplicity is not healthy.
Title: Self-Organized Criticality (SOC) Content: A concept called self-organised criticality (SOC), first described in 1987 by the physicists Per Bak, Chao Tang and Kurt Wiesenfeld of the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, helps to explain  why complexity is healthy.The brain is by default in an unstable state known as criticality. Complex brain activity complements a finely-balanced state of the brain (Self-Organized Criticality) that can go lopsided with too much straightening, so being ‘crooked’ is a feature, not a bug.
Title: Complexity Is An Algorithm Content: The finely-tuned complexity of the brain functions like an algorithm that balances opposing tendencies of stability and instability. Many psychiatric disorders like autism and schizophrenia are associated with a disruption in the balance and tuning of the complex neural interactions.These new findings on the neural complexity of the brain will soon allow doctors to study and predict various neurological disorders.
