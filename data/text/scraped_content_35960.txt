Title: Forming New Memories Content: Our consciousness is deeply connected to our thinking and memory, and self-remembrance is an automatic feature of our brain.People who have survived accidents or illness which limit their brain functioning, making them unable to form any new memory, question the presumption we have of our minds being our sole repository of identity.
Title: Amnesia: The Forgotten Life Content: People who are unable to form new memories have to adjust to a stark reality of losing their pre-amnesia lives. To live without the means to form any ‘autobiographical’ memory, makes the patients unable to ground their sense of identity, or even orient themselves to maintain a timeline of their existence in their minds.The only guiding light in the dark is the present moment and the action that they are doing with their entire bodies.
Title: The Holistic Nature Of Personhood Content: The identity of ourselves isn’t just limited to the mind, and is in fact the property of the entire body. A study in how poems take formation provides an insight on Rilkean memory, which encompasses the entire being, and is the complete existential response to the world, unlike the conscious thinking response of the mind.  The behavioural disposition and enduring mood arise when the conscious, narrative memory is gone.
