Title: We don't need positive thinking Content: Positive thinking tends to separate situations in terms of good and bad. First, you think something is bad, then you have to actively think it is less bad, but you always know you are fooling yourself. You don't have to go through life labeling what happens to you. Don't pick up that useless burden. You can de-condition yourself and experience less stress.
Title: "Good" or "Bad" Content: We tend to view something as either good or bad. And most of us use the "bad" label more often than the "good" label.But, not everything we label as bad, is bad. We can all recall instances of something we initially thought was a bad thing, only to realize later that it was a good thing.
Title: Don't apply labels Content: When people are faced with extreme adversity, some persons positively flourish while others fall apart.Those who rise successfully do not place a label on what they go through. They take every circumstance as a given. It is merely something they have to address.
