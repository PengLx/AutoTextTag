Title: A positive frame of mind Content: It is a really good idea to force yourself into a positive frame of mind at least once per day. No matter what happens each day, when you sit down for dinner, think about the good in your life for at least a few seconds.Positive thinking opens your eyes to more opportunities.
Title: The cumulative effect Content: The individual impact of any one piece of gratitude is small, but the cumulative effect is huge. The power of this habit comes from a multiplier effect that takes hold after practicing it for a month or two. You begin to realize that nearly every day is a good day (at least in a small way).
Title: Gratitude is free Content: You start to realize how insignificant monetary things are for your day-to-day happiness. The majority of your grateful moments don’t cost a dime: time spent with friends and family, something nice someone said, a good workout that day.That’s not to say money is unimportant, but there is something comforting in realizing that the moments you’re actually grateful for each day are free.
Title: Small habit Content: The gratitude habit is incredibly small. There are not many habits that you are able to pick up immediately and follow every day.
Title: Habit stacking Content: A habit can be tied to another behavior. Using the idea of habit stacking, stack your gratitude habit on top of your habit of eating dinner each night. It is so much easier to build a new habit into your lifestyle when you choose the right trigger.
