Title: Information storms Content: We often feel overwhelmed when we are exposed to a large volume of information. We also rely on secondary knowledge that does not come from any external source.To put it another way: rightly or wrongly, we think what other people think.The digital culture has taken this reliance on social information to a new level, with new sets of hazards, anxieties, manipulation and influence.
Title: How misinformation builds  Content: When we encounter unfamiliar information on a social network, we verify it in one of two ways. We either go through the burdensome process of countless claims and counter-claims to understand if it is true, or we rely on others by way of social proof.If we search for online information, instead of coming up with our own way of assessing the quality or the usefulness of every website, we rely on Google's PageRank algorithm to come up with the best sites. In essence, we rely on other people to source information by use of user traffic, reviews, ratings, clicks and likes.
Title: How to handle an infostorm Content: Infostorms are like actual storms: they are a product of climatic conditions. Different climates can produce different results.The more we understand the chain of events that led to a particular view, the better we are equipped to appreciate it if we are skeptical or take into account other perspectives.
