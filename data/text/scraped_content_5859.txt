Title: In order to stay motivated, you need a purpose Content:  Without purpose, motivation does not stand a chance. So start thinking about your purpose, what makes your inner motivation stay alive and do your best to accomplish it.
Title: Improve your personal accountability Content: Making sure you hold yourself accountable in order to keep up the motivation and, therefore, accomplish your goals, is easier than it sounds. All you have to do is to commit and express your commitment also in front of others. This will lead to you wanting to be consistent and, therefore, it will make it harder to give up.
Title: Rewards and motivation Content: It might be that nothing motivates one as a reward. Knowing that you will be rewarded after having completed the task has a strong influence on your brain.
