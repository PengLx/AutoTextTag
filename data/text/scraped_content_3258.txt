Title: Understanding Content: The first step in forgiveness is to understand "why" someone acts the way they do.What are they trying to protect? What are they afraid of? What basic skills did they learn (or not learn) from their family of origin?Understanding "why" breeds compassion and helps loosen the ties that bind us to blame.
Title: Feel and express your emotions Content: Until we fully release our emotions, they continue to affect our present mindset.Do anger work.Allow yourself to be fully disappointed, sad or depressed. Talk about it.Write a letter. Purging emotions out on paper give them a place to live outside of yourself.Talk to the person (if possible).This is only helpful if it is safe for you to speak with the person.It is usually not effective when you are angry or until you have processed your emotions significantly on your own.
Title: Rebuild safety Content: Create new boundaries for yourself within the relationship.This may mean you no longer see the person, end the relationship or establish new guidelines.
Title: Let go Content: Fully letting go of a past transgression and completely forgiving may take many months or years.You may have a phase of feeling better and then realize that you are still grieving or angry. Be patient. It is a process.
