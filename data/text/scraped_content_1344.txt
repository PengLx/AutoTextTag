Title: A Story Of Buddha Content: An old devotee of Lord Rama was close to his death. He heard of Buddha and wanted confirmation on Godâ€™s existence. Buddha, knowing the man was a devotee, said there was no God.Later a devout atheist who dedicated many years to spreading the atheist message came to Buddha and asked if there was a God. Buddha, knowing that man was an atheist, said firmly that there was a God.
Title: The meaning behind Story of Buddha Content: Atheism and theism are equally useless, one has to realize the truth in himself with diligent self-effort. Buddha had told both men what they needed to know in order to get stronger on their spiritual quest.
