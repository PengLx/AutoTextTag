Title: White noise Content: White noise is the sound of all the frequencies that humans can hear and is at the same intensity, such as a fan or crashing waves.Around the globe, millions of people are downloading white noise apps in the hope of getting better sleep at night. However, research suggests that they don't work and that they even may make things worse.
Title: Theories around white noise Content: One theory is that white noise helps to drown out other bothersome sounds. Another is that listening to the same sound each night may help people to associate it with falling asleep.Studies show that although there is evidence that people fall asleep sooner, the quality of the evidence was poor. There is also a concern of potential ill-effects of not allowing the auditory system to switch off overnight, although this has not yet been tested.
