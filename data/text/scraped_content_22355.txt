Title: Sleep And The Process Of Keeping Our Brains Healthy Content: Quality sleep is the one universal factor that can keep our brain healthy.Sleep is so important that mammals die in about a week if they are completely deprived of sleep.While we think our lights are out when we sleep, our brain is very much active and uses a lot of energy.
Title: Neurophysiology 101 Content: Neurons are the nervous system cells transmitting electromagnetic signals using action potentials and neurotransmitters.Glia is the non-neuronal system cell keeping the neurons healthy and working.Cerebrospinal Fluid or CSF is the fluid that our brain lives in.Arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood to an organ.Veins are the blood vessels carrying blood from the organ.
Title: The Brain Is Like A City Content: Complex cycles and systems operate in the brain. The Glymphatic (or Glial Lymphatic) system, discovered recently, takes care of the brain waste much like a complex sewer system.The system is only active when one is asleep, and it clears our brain of all neurotoxic substances that have collected during the day.
Title: Sleep Is Not a Luxury Or An Option Content: It affects our learning, metabolism, hypertension, insulin sensitivity, and of course, mood.Not getting enough sleep used to be something to boast of, but is now a sign of self-neglect and upcoming health issues.
