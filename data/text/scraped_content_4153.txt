Love & Relationships,Personal Development
Title: 'Single' Positivity Content: A new breed of 'single-positive' personalities reject the notion that you need a partner to be happy and have a fulfilling life.These 'self-partnering' individuals are seeing that being single is not being lonely or depressed, but is leading them to experience life as a positive and exciting ride.
Title: You Are Enough Content: Many single women are starting to realize that they are not losing much by being single, but are gaining a lot of freedom and time to do self-care and pursue things that matter to them.
Title: Do Stuff, Alone Content: The stigma of being spotted doing something alone by others is now diminishing.People are traveling, eating, catching a movie, visiting the local pub, all alone and positively enjoying it.
Title: Happy Alone Content: Due to society's pressure, people get into relationships that are increasingly turning toxic after a while.Many women and even men are discovering that the relationships have made them stressed out.Being single provides them with the independence, freedom and flexibility that they cannot imagine while being in a relationship.
Title: 'Marrying' Yourself Content: Many books and movies reflect this 'singledom' lifestyle choice, and it is more than just traveling or dating alone.Society has always favored a family, as opposed to an individual, so being single, and in a 'sologamy' mode is filled with challenges.
Title: Do What You Want Content: It is a misguided and increasingly obsolete assumption that being in a relationship should be the norm.Being in a relationship should be an option, not a necessity.
