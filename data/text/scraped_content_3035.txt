Title: You Always Have a Choice Content: You have no control over things like the place you were born, your biological sex, the situation of your family or your skin color. These things will obviously impact your life in major ways.But while you may not be to blame for your situation, you are always responsible for figuring out how to deal with your situation.
Title: Adopt a Bias Towards Action Content: Most people's approach to work motivation goes like this: they wait to be inspired, then they get to work.But successful people don’t sit around and wait for inspiration. They just show up and get to work.
Title: Let Go of the Need to Be Right Content: Everyone is almost certainly wrong about pretty much everything. And we can never be 100% sure we’re right about anything.We can only learn from our observations and hopefully be a little less wrong.
Title: See the World for What It Is Content: ... not for what you wish it could be.Appear to human nature rather than railing against it. You can’t change other people’s behavior by appealing to their moral code. The opposite will happen.
Title: Define Success Internally Content: ... not externally. The modern culture ideas that "more is better" and that "we can have it all" are toxic.Happiness isn't something you should pursue for its own sake. In fact, trying to “feel good” all the time will only make you feel miserable.
