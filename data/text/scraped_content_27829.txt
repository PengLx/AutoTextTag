Title: The A Player Content: Many stories have a lone person, who is unknown but eventually becomes a hero due to his years of toiling and getting success. We like to think of this ‘heroic’ feat as something done exclusively by the hero.The role of the team, the other people that are not in the frame is often overlooked. Any important achievement cannot be done alone, and if we look closely, a person is a product of the education system, society, environment, luck, the internet and a lot more.
Title: The Leader With A Team Content: The job of a leader is to get the right team, which according to an estimate provides three times more output than an average team.The work of a leader isn’t as simple as hiring the best talent, and merely putting smart people together as a team is not an effective strategy.
Title: Individual Intelligence Vs Group Intelligence Content: Any combination of individual intelligence does not make an intelligent group, no matter how logical it sounds on paper.The ‘A’ Players, the cream of individual intelligence, bring in drive, integrity and the ability to mentor, but all of which is not possible without the collective effort of other players of the team, who are not A players.
