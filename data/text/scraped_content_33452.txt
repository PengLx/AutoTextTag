Title: The Perception Game Of Organizations Content: Many managers and even entire organizations perceive employees who spend more time working at the desk, coming early and leaving late from work, as sincere, dependable and hard-working.Managers expect workers to show their face in ‘work-mode’ at the desk, using the principle of hour-based productivity. This observational activity of managers ‘clocking’ their employee’s desk time, no matter what the level of productivity is, is called Passive Face-Time.
Title: Time Measurement Vs Time Management Content: Productivity does not come from sitting idle at the office for hours.Employees who are able to manage their time well and have a great work-life balance are more productive and should be valued over a person spending a lot of time in office but achieving little.
Title: Stop Using Time As A Productivity Measure Content: Avoid unnecessary meetings, as many meetings could be some form of excuse for the organizer to look busy and productive.Have clearly-defined productivity goals, instead of filling up calendars to have an illusion of productivity, while being busy just for the sake of it.Many repetitive tasks can be delegated, automated or even avoided.The Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, tells us that 80 percent of our success will come from 20 percent of our efforts.Protect your time and practice mindful time-blocking to take care of important tasks.
