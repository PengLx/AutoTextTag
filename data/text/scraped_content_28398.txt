Title: A Psychologically Rich Life Content: The definition of a good life has been divided into two main conceptualizations by many great philosophers and thinkers.A Happy Life or hedonic well-being involves pleasure, positivity and enjoyment.A Meaningful Life or eudaimonic well-being is full of virtue, purpose, devotion, and even sacrifice.
Title: The Third Concept Of Life Content: New research points out towards the third conceptualization of a good life (besides a happy life and a meaningful one): The psychologically rich life.It is a life full of intense, deep emotions, complex and diverse mental engagements, and surprising experiences, making the psychologically rich life both pleasant, meaningful and novel. This may or may not involve any kind of economic richness.
Title: When Perfect Becomes Boring Content: No one really talks about it, but a picture-perfect life with a steady office job, nice car, a great family may be satisfying and meaningful but still become monotonous and boring.The cracks start to show after a few years in the form of mid-life crisis or family issues like marital problems.
Title: Reversing Your Life Choices Content: Several studies point out that a sizable number of people would love to reverse their lifeâ€™s choices of settling down early or staying in college for four years for a worthless degree.The curious minds who are open to new kinds of experiences (both positive and negative) regret neglecting their instinct towards obtaining a richer, more intense slice of life, making it psychologically rich.
