Title: Location Content: Organizing information by its location (physical or conceptual) is important when the information has multiple different sources and locales.Use it when the relative position of the information you want to present is important. When giving directions or to prioritize what is the most relevant thing to be in reach.
Title: Alphabet Content: Ordering information alphabetically is a great way to provide random access to data. It is one of the best ways to organize information when the amount of data is big (Dictionaries, encyclopedias, book indexes for example).It is also a good fall back when the information can’t be sorted with another method.
Title: Time Content: Time is a great way of categorizing events that have happened over a fixed time duration.Use it to present and compare events over a fixed time duration. It allows us to observe and compare changes that occur in that time frame.
Title: Category Content: Using categories is a great way to organize information when it needs to be sorted by similarity or relatedness.But keep in mind that this has a certain degree of subjectivity in it: people don’t always group things the same way. Also, be careful with the number of sub-categories that might appear.
Title: Hierarchy Content: Organizing things by hierarchy is helpful when  the information can be organized by comparing things across a common measure (small to large, lowest to highest, etc.)
