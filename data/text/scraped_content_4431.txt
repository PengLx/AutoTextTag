Title: Be steady and dependable Content: As a leader, being reliable and responsible is important for your team. You stand a good chance in gaining the trust of your team if you show that you exercise caution, take calculated risks, and will hold to the organizational principles. 
Title: Modesty is the best policy Content: There is a degree of responsibility (and professionalism) that is expected from those in charge.Trying to be the fun boss will harm your reputation eventually. It is good to keep some space between you and your team.
