Title: Contentment: The Choice Is Ours Content: Life has challenges, misery and struggles for everyone inhabiting this planet, and it is our choice to be happy or unhappy, because our behaviours, thoughts and attitude are what makes our condition good or bad.By counting our blessings and focusing on the good things in life, instead of the one bad thing that has happened and is the center of attention, we choose to have power over the situation and stir life towards happiness, in spite of the circumstances.
Title: The Process Of Transformation Through Contentment Content: When we feel a sense of contentment, our satisfaction influences our overall happiness.A simple, minimalistic way of life can help us curb many unwanted desires that cause misery in the future (including financial troubles).The contentment over our significant other boosts any relationship and avoids our efforts to change others into versions we like.Contentment leads us to accept our children and love them as they are, instead of imposing undesirable conditions on them.Being content with a good job helps us avoid being a complaining, grumpy person, leading to more opportunities in the future.Social change is possible if we are content with ourselves and can therefore work positively in the bigger issues that plague the earth.
Title: Moving Towards Contentment Content: Focus on and give gratitude for what you have, and not what you have lost.Take a deep breath when you try to change someone, understand that their faults are part of the package.When you have an urge to buy something, wait for 30 days.Appreciate your life, reflecting on the moments like a good walk in nature in the morning, looking at the rising sun.Give people a smile and thank them for their work.Just breathe and smile, taking the time to pause for calmness and serenity.
