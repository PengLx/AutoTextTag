Title: 100 Percent Commitment Content: Clear-cut, zero-tolerance decisions and self-commitments are better than having to decide every time, or committing conditionally.A 100 percent decision is better than a conditional decision, which can lead to decision fatigue and waste your limited willpower.
Title: Loose Commitment And Decision Fatigue Content: If you are only 90 percent committed to your goal (like following a certain diet, for example) you have to ask yourself and test your commitment multiple times a day.You end up unable to predict your behaviour, and any future outcomes.By having a loose commitment setting in your mind, you are bound to deal with decision fatigue and see yourself repeatedly fail, lowering your confidence.
Title: Setting In Stone Future Behavior Content: When the commitment is 100 percent, your future behaviour is already set in stone, with no back-and-forth struggle and revisiting of the decision-making condition.When your best friend offers you a Coke, you know very well that the decision to not have anything like that is already made, and it is easy to say no.
