Title: Focus on progress Content: Shifting your focus from perfection to progress allows you to acknowledge the presence of accomplishments and blessings rather than the absence of your idea of “perfection.”
Title: Stop comparing Content: Stop comparing yourself to others and take a moment to be thankful for even the tiniest of blessings in your life that are far too often taken for granted.
Title: Let go Content: There’s a Zen proverb that reads, “Let go or be dragged.” Times of transition are opportunities to allow yourself to shed what no longer serves you: people, habits, thoughts -- whatever it may be. Fill your life with more of what makes you happy and leave no room for the toxic people and practices that drag you down.
