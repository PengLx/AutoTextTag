Title: Wisdom is earned Content: We can only earn wisdom. It cannot be given to us. When we receive answers from someone else, we might achieve the desired outcome, but the solution comes from dependence, not insight.There is nothing wrong with buying insight. The problem is when we think the insight of others is our own.
Title: Owning wisdom Content: Wisdom is not as simple as just reading. The rules and simplicities given by others may make us feel we're getting brighter, but it is not real.Owning wisdom requires a discipline to continue learning and not to shun the details and complexity. It is boring. It takes time. But it is the only way.
