Title: Teams with clarity Content: ...know exactly what they’re doing, why they’re doing it, and who’s responsible.Mostly, teams get clarity from leaders who are habitual about creating it.And that takes commitment to three things: Clarity of purpose, clarity of plan, and clarity of responsibility.
Title: Clarity of Purpose Content: If you have clarity of purpose, everyone is on the same page when asked, “If we’re wildly successful, how will the world be different?”Some of the best teams in the business today are those driven by a purpose connected to a vision for a more helpful, innovative, or thriving world.
Title: Clarity of plan Content: It provides the “how”:Spend a few days in focused planning with your team.Lay out thepillars that you believe will lead to success in your mission–your “master strategy.”Establish a set of measurable key results that you aim to achieve by specific dates, to support these pillars.Map out the big projects that your team will take on to achieve those key results, and then the specific tasks to achieve them.
Title: Clarity of responsibility Content: ...answers the question of “who".When no one is responsible for something, it doesn’t get done.When two or more people share unclear responsibility, it still doesn’t get done.The clarity of responsibility ensures that one person holds the ultimate responsibility for each piece of the plan.
