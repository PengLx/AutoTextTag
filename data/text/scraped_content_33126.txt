Title: The Error in Isolating Events Content: Many studies have been conducted regarding the psychological impact of a one particular event, like the trauma associated with the ongoing health crisis, or sudden job loss.What researchers fail to gauge is the complex psychological experiences of various events and situations that are of different hues and colors, and happen simultaneously.A normal person leading a full life can experience events related to death, family changes, job changes, health issues, and financial swings. Each experience is connected to the other experiences and is not isolated, making the impact on the person varied and complex.
Title: Good News, Bad News Content: A comprehensive study on Australian households, measuring the quality of wellbeing over 16 years found the following results:The biggest emotional scars come from deaths, divorce, and heavy financial losses.Negative events linger in the mind for much longer than the positive ones.The emotional costs involved with separation (like from a spouse) can be significant, and should be avoided unless completely necessary.Problems rarely come all at once, and most people recover, showing resilience and adaptability.
Title: You Remain What You Are Content: Our level of wellbeing does not change much, with each event, even a catastrophic one, impacting us for a length of time, say a year or two, and then becoming normal to our minds, returning us to our previous levels of wellbeing. This applies to boosts as well as the plunges.
Title: Stop Chasing Happiness Content: Research shows an unexpected finding: happiness does not come from marriage, financial profits and other big events in your life, but it is available in the little things of daily life. The events just become temporary surges or declines, with real happiness waiting for you everyday, in the present moment.
