Title: Anti-Social Social Media Content: Studies show that the younger demographic wants restricted, private, secure and exclusive networks which cannot be thronged by unwanted people, like their parents.These exclusive online social places can be termed as digital campfires, and are mainly in the domains of private messaging, micro-communities and shared experiences.
Title: Private Messaging Campfire Content: Private messaging services like Facebook Messenger and Whatsapp are where private interactions happen and people are comfortable sharing details in private group messaging.There are new applications like Tex-Rex, The Infatuation, or Community which are helping brands penetrate this private space.
Title: Micro-Communities Campfire Content: Micro-communities are platforms where people gather around shared interests, beliefs or passions. Some examples are Facebook Pages and Groups, Instagram Stories, Slack and Youtube.Brands can tap into this by partnering with influencers who have the kind of demographic they are targeting.
Title: Shared Experiences Campfire Content: This is where like-minded people are participating in an activity. Online multiplayer games like Fortnite have 200 million users, and teens spend many hours on it keeping up with virtual friends and attending virtual concerts and events within the platform.Brands can tap into these shared experience campfires by associating with and creating virtual activities that are related to the audience grouped together and participating actively due to their shared interest.
