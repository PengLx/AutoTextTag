Title: The value of complaining Content: As important and healing as gratitude is, we can't be grateful all the time. There is a time when we also have to make room for complaints.For weeks, we've been going through phases. Hoarding and planning move into anxiety and stress, and now we've entered the stale phase. We've planned to be productive, but struggle to self-motivate.Complaining is a survival tool to help you cope if you use it wisely.
Title: Complaining is better with others Content: Make space for other people to vent aloud. They know that they are powerless, and they have to accept the situation. Venting gives them the illusion that they are in control.Have a little competition with your best complaints.Create a house chart of complaints where your kids can let out their own. Avoid complaining mistakes (such as: getting carried away by anger, firing too many complaints at a time or thinking that complaining alone will save us from our problems).
