Title: Building effective teams Content: It means figuring out how to assemble the right mix of people and expertise to deliver the most efficient and effective outcome.
Title: Clear direction Content: Start at the endpoint: What is the outcome you want and why? Leave the team some flexibility to develop the best way to get there.Without a clear sense of what the team needs to accomplish and how a successful outcome will be defined, it's impossible to assemble the right group of people to get there.
Title: Efficient practices Content: Look at the workflow and resources available to help you understand the scope of the project and what support the team will need to be successful.Important questions to keep in mind:Is your organization prepared to support the team in its objectives? Will they have the right tools and resources to complete their tasks? How will you measure their efficiency during the process and monitor it for improvement?
Title: Defined roles Content: Roles might shift somewhat once the team is assembled, but an understanding of the skill sets and thinking styles is important for the team.For example, the explorer will be more of a big-picture thinker who can help the team see what is possible and the number-cruncher will take charge of measurement and metrics, etc.
