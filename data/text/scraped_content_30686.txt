Title: Making sense of the world together Content: This is the secret of really good conversations.Many of our best conversations, whether with people we have just met or with old friends, are about the world around us rather than ourselves. These are also often the conversations that bring us closer to each other.
Title: Experiencing shared reality Content: The theory of shared reality implies that we are most likely to feel closer to each other when we turn our mutual attention to something beyond ourselves.So the responsibility of keeping the conversation going falls how on the way we engage in the world, cultivating our curiosity and priming our awareness. This means that whether we’re talking to a person we don't know, a partner or teammate, we’ll always have something to talk about.
