Title: Reason to set priorities Content: When we don’t set priorities, we tend to follow the path of least resistance.We’ll pick and sort through the things we need to do and work on the easiest tasks– leaving the more difficult and less fun tasks for a “later” that, in many cases, never comes – or, worse, comes just before the action needs to be finished, throwing us into a whirlwind of activity, stress, and regret.

Into each of those quadrants, you put your tasks according to whether they are:Important and Urgent Important and Not Urgent Not Important but Urgent Not Important and Not UrgentYou’d like to spend as much time as possible in Quadrant II, plugging away at tasks that are important with plenty of time to really get into them and do the best possible job.
