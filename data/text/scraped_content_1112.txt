Title: How to Be a Good Listener Content: Good listening is active, not passive:Maintain eye contact.Do not fidget, shift your body weight often, and never look at your watch!Nod your head to show agreement but do not interrupt to make your point or share your own experiences.Respond by repeating at least one key point the person you are talking with just made in the form of a question.
Title: How to Ask the Right Questions Content: Keep questions positive and focused.Ask a question that is on-topic whenever possible. If the topic is negative, do not just suddenly change topics. It will make the speaker uncomfortable. Instead, give an empathetic reply to show support and then ask a question to redirect to something that is still related, but allows the speaker to respond with something a little more positive.
