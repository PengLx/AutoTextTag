Title: Learning Drives Adaptability Content: A learning mindset makes it less likely you’ll be thrown off or immobilized when a project changes the scope or a job function undergoes a transformation, especially if you have soft skills. While others scramble to adapt, lifelong learners maintain momentum and productivity.
Title: Companies Want Avid Lifelong Learners Content: The skills gap is often defined as the difference between the skills future workers have and the skills employers seek in new hires. But the skills gap also exists for the already employed workers and can keep growing unless they keep their skills up to date.
Title: Curiosity Is Career Fuel Content: Understanding how your efforts fit into the bigger picture will give your work more meaning and give you new ideas to apply, so you don’t burn out or stagnate. Learning about something you’re curious about, even if it’s not useful to your job, expands your thinking, and impacts everything you do.
