Title: Beginner's Luck Content: Beginner's luck does not actually exist. Most of the time the beginner has a similar skill that aids them. Or the novice could be new to the task, but have tried it before and failed repeatedly.
Title: Anything Is Possible For The Beginner Content: To the beginner, anything Is possible. They are not blocked by experience and are willing to try out many possibilities and solve problems creatively.The expert has narrowed down the possibilities and can become too comfortable with their own perspectives.
Title: Experts Break Under Pressure Content: When you are good at something, you're under pressure to perform at your level. A novice doesn't particularly care how they perform and doesn't feel any pressure to perform.
Title: Muscle Memory and Hard-Wired Routines Content: Most experts developed some sort of muscle memory for the things they do. This is extremely useful for repeat tasks, but when up against a novice or when in an unusual situation, hard-wired routines can cause them to act quickly without thinking. 
Title: How to Fabricate Beginner's Luck Content: Don't apply the same experience to anything new. In every situation, consider what you've seen before and what's different.Consider crazy ideas and strategies even if you are sure they will not work.If you have an idea you really like but are afraid to try it, you probably have a unique idea that could be worth the risk.Listen to your gut instead of your brain when you are over-thinking. Consider your options when you are under-thinking.Think with a beginners-mind. Consider the the problem from the perspective of a novice.
