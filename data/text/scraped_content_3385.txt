Title: “Maybe Next Time” Content: This will allow you to politely shut down a person'srequest without brutally closing the door entirely.It works especially well for social obligations.
Title: “No, Thank You” Content: If and when you don’t want to do something, reply with a simple, “No, thank you.”Sometimes, trying to offer an explanation of your refusal will open the door for arguments and maybe even for a future similar invitation. By offering this answer,you’ve made it clear that you’re not interested.
