Title: Say what the problem is Content: ... and if you must amplify your message, say where your data came from.Never try to simultaneously be a good cop and a bad cop.Make it clear that your goal is constructive change.
Title: Ambiguity is your enemy Content: ... when telling someone they're wrong.Be concrete and don't sermonize, even if the person that's receiving your criticism knows she did something wrong.
Title: Deal in facts Content: Objectivity is crucial to constructive criticism.The goal is to communicate that a performance standard has not been met. Your sentiments/judgments are irrelevant.
Title: Focus on behavior, not character Content: For example, in saying "You were lazy in preparing this report" you may think you are helping the other person to improve a skills; instead, it addresses your assumption about the person's attitude toward their work.
Title: Show them the way Content: Criticism without an action plan is worthless.Give people direction or keep your mouth shut.
Title: Let the fixes feel like their own Content: If people feel you support their fundamental views and value them, the change will be easy and natural.
