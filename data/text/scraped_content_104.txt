Title: Doing the math for better decisions Content: It forces you to not rush and assume the answers to questions without actually going out into the world and checking them first. It may take a few minutes to pull up a spreadsheet and see how one approach compares with another, but the answer you get will be far more accurate than if you had skipped the work and just stuck with prevailing assumptions.
Title: Doing the math: life problems Content: If your problem involves comparing 2 things that happen at the same time, then just add up the 2 effects and see which is bigger.If your problem involves comparing 2 things that happen at different points in time, you need to discount things that happen later.If your problem involves comparing things that arenâ€™t directly comparable (say the benefit of enjoying your job more versus earning more money), you can convert one to the other by imagining a trade-off point for each.
