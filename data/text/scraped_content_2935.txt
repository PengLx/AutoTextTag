Make sure that you explain the technical terms and concepts that you use as you are using it.
Title: Debiasing techniques Content: Use various debiasing techniques in order to help you account for the influence of the curse of knowledge.Visualize the perspective of the people that you are communicating with or use self-distancing language.You could also slow down your reasoning process and improve your decision-making environment, which will enable you to think in a clearer, less-biased manner.
