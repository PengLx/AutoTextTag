Title: The benefits of crying Content: From a psychotherapy point of view, releasing of emotions is a very good thing, especially when we have allowed emotions to build up inside for too long.Crying doesn't just feel like a release; it releases toxins (which decreases stress), endorphins (hormones that make us feel happier), and oxytocin (the hormone that connects us with others).
Title: Crying during a movie Content: During a movie, crying is particularly helpful because you're connecting to some emotion on the screen without actually going through it in real life.For example, if there is a death in a movie and it resonates with us, it may help us reconnect with our grief.
