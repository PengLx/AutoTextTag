Title: Two types of people Content: Those that can start things, but have trouble completing it.Those that can finish things, but have difficulty starting.You probably have a bigger problem with one or the other, even if you feel like you face both these situations.
Title: Struggling to start Content: Dismissing every reason to start is perfectionism. It manifests as procrastination.Forget about passion and needing something to be perfect. Just start and keep going.
Title: Struggling to finish Content: Maybe you are brimming with options. You find it easy to take action on almost anything set in front of you. Your challenge is to find the time to do it all or to maintain the interest to keep going.Don't wait until you feel like doing it. Take action regardless and enjoy your feelings if you also happen to "feel like it."
