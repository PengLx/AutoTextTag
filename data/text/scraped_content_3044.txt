Title: Figure out your needs Content: People tend to feel badly about themselves when they feel powerless to get their needs met.Clarify for yourself what you need and don't expect others to fulfill your every want.What people, places, or experiences are must-haves to live a fulfilling life? What aspects of your life—if removed—would leave you without a sense of purpose? 
Title: Live authentically Content: Standing up for yourself and living a life that is authentically yours generates positive self-views.You have to start thinking about how you will communicate your needs, how you will start creating a life that meets your needs, and what you will do if people in your life can’t meet those needs.
Title: Forgive yourself Content: Almost everyone has said something hurtful, forgotten an important event, or betrayed someone they love.We have to remember that our mistakes do not define us. If we learn and grow from them, then they make us better people.Forgive yourself, and give yourself credit for trying not to make the same mistakes again.
Title: Celebrate your quirks Content: Instead of focusing on all the things wrong with us, self-celebration enables us to derive deep satisfaction from being uniquely us.Practice self-celebration by enjoying your awkward laugh or poking fun at your inability to remember people’s names.
