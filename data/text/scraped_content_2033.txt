Title: Styles of learning Content: The concept of learning styles--such as visual versus verbal or active versus reflective--is commonplace, but it turns out that there is little evidence to support it.
Title: Right-brained or left-brained Content: Research doesnâ€™t strongly support this concept of the lateral brain--or that people have a dominant side of the brain that dictates how we learn.Even in simple actions, both hemispheres of the brain are engaged.
Title: "Exercises" that will make you smarter Content: "One minute playing Mozart will make your baby a genius, the next crosswords will fend off your mental decline"... The research behind these claims is weak.Learning methods are not so much based upon how the brain is structured, but based upon our experiences. Our experiences do affect brain development. The wiring of the brain depends upon the experiences we have.
