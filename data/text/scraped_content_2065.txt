Title: Observe your emotions Content: ... without judging.However you feel is fine. Emotions are attention-getting devices that the mind uses to help you observe your thoughts.Notice, especially, when you don’t feel good.
Title: Notice thoughts behind the emotions Content: Feelings are caused by thoughts. You can access these thoughts by asking “Why? I feel this way?”The thoughts behind the emotion can show you your mind’s misunderstandings, because any thought that causes an unpleasant emotion is likely caused by an assumption. And assumptions can be redefined.
Title: Channel your inner toddler Content: Question everything. Ask yourself what you might be assuming.Dig deeply, and look at every facet of that assumption. It might be helpful to type or write this out.
Title: Question your beliefs Content: Look at the “evidence” for your belief.The mind can only see evidence for what it already believes. Seek what experiences is your mind using to prove its “negative thought” true. List them. Then ask why they are true and if they make sense.
Title: Come up with other possibilities Content: ... and find evidence for at least one of them. Your mind is subconsciously finding evidence for its assumptions, and now you are going to fight fire with fire.Repetition is how the mind learns. Eventually, your subconscious mind will accept your redefinitions, and you will see a natural end to your negative thoughts.
