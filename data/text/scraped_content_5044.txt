Title: Metaphors Content: Metaphors use familiar objects and phenomena to help think through and talk about abstract ideas.Although metaphors can illustrate ideas and provide insight, they can also limit them. There comes a point when the limits they impose will outweigh the understanding they provide.
Title: Metaphors shape our actions Content: Some studies suggest that one in every 25 words we use is a metaphor. The choice of metaphor can form the way we see the world and act upon it.In a series of experiments, participants were given two identical reports about crime, except that one report described the crime as "a wild beast preying on the city" and the other "a virus infecting the city." When asked for solutions, those who read the first report suggested stricter law enforcement, while those who read the second proposed social reforms.
Title: The role of metaphors Content: Metaphors, like “trickle-down economics” and “red wall,” help frame the issues and also our responses to social and political discussions.When politicians compare the national economy to a household budget, they want us to think in specific ways about national debt or policies of austerity. Metaphors also play a role in science. Science accepts that metaphors can be limiting, but admit that they are an essential tool for thinking.
