Title: Commitment to Personal Goals Content: Generally, people don't train in themselves the habits, self-knowledge and control structures to ensure they act on their plans and goals.You can be better at committing to things by practice, but commitment cannot be practiced on its own. It must be practiced in conjunction with some other goal.
Title: Improve Your Ability to Stick to Things Content: Start with projects that should be easy to commit to. Don’t start with projects of 3-6 months if you don’t have a strong track-record of one-month successes behind you.Start becoming more sensitive about what you commit to.Be cautious about overcommitting.If you need future flexibility, bake it into your initial commitment, don’t try to wiggle it in later.Raise the bar on what counts as a valid excuse. View commitment as a long-term skill-building project.
