Title: Anger is caused by impulsive judgment Content: Getting angry is about facing some form of perceived threat. It also involves a knee-jerk reaction to negative feelings such as shame, guilt, anxiety, powerlessness, rejection, or feelings of inadequacy.Anger is often caused by impulsive judgment about an event or behaviors.
Title: The “It’s happening again!” trigger for anger Content: Thinking, "I'm getting angry again" is a strong trigger for overly intense anger. When this happens, the negative feelings that we associate with this thought make our emotional reactions worse.  Common feelings include shame, guilt, feelings of inadequacy. If we know we have not made peace with our past hurts, we are more likely to experience this emotional reaction.
Title: Changing destructive anger into healthy anger Content: This process requires us to pause and reflect on our internal experiences.A meaningful component is to identify the negative feelings behind it and the conclusions we make. We should realize that our reaction in the moment may not only be about the current event but also about previous hurts.Meeting this challenge requires attention beyond only controlling anger. It takes self-observation about the moments when anger arise. This way, we can immediately recognize that our reaction to a situation incorporates reactions coming from previous hurts.
