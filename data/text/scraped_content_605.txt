Title: Self-improvement junkies Content: For them, the purpose of self-improvement is rather motivated by a subtle form of FOMO (fear of missing out).They feel like they need to jump on every new seminar, read all the latest books, listen to all the podcasts, lift all the weight, hire all the life coaches, open all their chakras, and talk about all their childhood traumas.
Title: Self-improvement tourists Content: These are the people that only come to self-help when things go wrong in life.They just got slapped in the face with a divorce or someone close to them just died and now they’re depressed.They use self-help material to fix whatever is bothering them, to get them back on their feet, and then they’re off into the world again.
Title: Paradox of self-improvement Content: The only way to truly benefit from self-improvement is to one day arrive at a place where you no longer need it.It’s fine to indulge in self-improvement material as long as you understand your relationship to it. And you make sure that it’s a relationship where you control it, not the other way around.
