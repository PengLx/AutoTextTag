Title: Human Evolution Content: Evolution is a gradual change in the DNA of a species over many centuries, occurring by natural selection when traits created by genetic mutations promote survival or reproduction in an organism.By looking at global DNA studies, it is evident that human evolution hasn’t stopped, but is happening at a faster rate than before.
Title: Stretch Genes Content: Human beings adapt to their environments genetically, over a period of time.Developing countries having populations with no access to proper health care continue to survive and thrive.In countries where infectious disease outbreaks have occurred in the past, survivors develop a natural resistance to the disease and pass it on to their offspring.People living in higher altitudes develop a mutated gene that increases blood oxygen content, resulting in better survival in the next generation.
Title: Our Diet Content: What we consume or don't consume influences our genes. Example: Countries where milk isn’t taken commonly, develop lactose intolerance and other digestive problems.Our Ultra-processed and super-unhealthy diets are also contributing to genetic adaptation, with studies showing changes in blood pressure and cholesterol levels. The upcoming result of this mutation of DNA is uncharted territory and will be more fully understood in the coming decades.
Title: Biased Gene Conversion Content: Certain molecular repairs seem to be happening in a biased way in our bodies, according to recent scientific studies of the genome. Certain ‘fast-evolving’ genes are rapidly accelerating, causing a fast rate of evolution.This is currently being studied and is pointing towards new kinds of genetic problems for future generations.
