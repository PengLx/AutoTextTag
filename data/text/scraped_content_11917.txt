Title: Create the conditions to write Content: Make the time for writing. We all have those absent-minded moments in our day when we're not doing anything. If we use that time to write, we can actually get a lot done.Lower the bar of writing. To overcome perfectionism, set a a goal and a deadline; this will help you get your words out without the need to have them perfect from the beginning.
Title: There's no one "right" way to write Content: Some people plan ahead their and outline their novels, others just jump in a wing it.Experiment, start with something and see what works for you. Try to show up for your characters. It's not important how you do it, as long as you do it.
Title: Find your people Content: When you feel a bit stuck, and walking the dog or organizing the closet doesn't help, speak to a friend with a different way of thinking. Or talk to a friend who's writing a book.aaaYou don't just have to stick to friends. Reach out to other writers who can talk through any issue you're having with your book.
Title: Read to refine your voice Content: Reading helps you find out what you like and enables you to refine your own voice.Reading will influence you, but your voice will always be your own.
Title: Learn to accept criticism with grace and humility Content: Having an accountability partner can be helpful to provide a different perspective and tell you when you've gotten something wrong.Maybe your prose is clunky, or perhaps your characters are stereotypical. If you're writing outside of your experience, you should know why you're doing it. Even if you do the research, discussion, bringing other people into your work, you might still get something wrong.
Title: The Real Writer mindset Content: If you write, you're a real writer. Whether you write poetry, fanfiction, letters to yourself, a description of experience - if you tell a story, you are the real deal.Just write, and you'll find yourself writing a book.
