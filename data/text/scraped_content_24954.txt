Title: Innovation and the status quo Content: In all societies, there are people and groups that want to maintain the status quo because it is in their interests to do so. Even if there are tensions, the most creative societies are those where it is still possible for the new thing to take over. If those who want to keep the status quo have too much power, a society will end up stagnating in terms of technology.
