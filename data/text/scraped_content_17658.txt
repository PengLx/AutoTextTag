Title: The power of practice Content: When you try something new and keep at it, you have no idea how good you can get. You can get really good, even if you think you are terrible right now.Talent matters only to some extent. Most routes can be successfully followed if you're willing to put in the time.
Title: Finding your fit Content: You may think that it's hard to practice relentlessly for years. You may not see yourself as someone who can put in the work for that amount of time. You can if you find the right fit.Once you find a fit and work on it for long enough, the lazy version of you can totally disappear. Start experimenting and get mentally ready to find your fit, then commit to practicing it.
