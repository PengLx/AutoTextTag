Title: How you speak to yourself Content: Itdirectly influences how you experience things in life.Our words play an important part in shaping our existence, so if your internal self-talk is negative, your external experiences will most likely be negative as well.
Title: Words and emotions Content: The words we attach to our experience become our experience.Words have a biochemical effect on the body. For example, if you use a word like “devastated,” you’re going to produce a very different biochemical effect than if you say, “I’m a bit disappointed.”
Title: Start with a small shift Content: Replace just one word that will transform the way you experience something “negative.” This is how you create a choice instead of a habitual reaction.These small changes in your vocabularygive you the power to change your experiences in life by lowering the intensity of negative emotions to the point where they no longer control you.
