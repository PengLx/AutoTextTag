Title: Our personalities can change Content: Many of us think our personality is fixed and unchangeable.But according to a recent study, while our early personalities may provide a baseline, they are pliable as we age. People's personality traits may change drastically over time.
Title: Why personality changes matter Content: Thinking of personality as fixed could leave us feeling like we can never grow or dismiss people with certain qualities, believing that change isn't possible. However, we don't simply change our personalities in random ways. The relationship among all of our personality traits seems to be more consistent.If someone was really conscientious but slightly disagreeable, they might keep that personality profile as they age, even if their other traits changed a bit.
Title: Our personalities are a mix Content: Personality seems to change cumulative over our lifespan and likely happens in response to our life experiences. Therefore our personalities are a mix of stable and unstable.Parents and teachers should keep that in mind when they try to influence a child's personality.Even the elderly, whom we might expect to be more set in their ways, can change.Partners would be better served by learning to value what remains constant in someone's personality while embracing personality shifts as they happen.
