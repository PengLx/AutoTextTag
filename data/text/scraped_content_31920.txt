Title: Back To School Content: Many people in their thirties and forties go back to a college to learn something that may be helpful in their ongoing career.The time when they had earlier attended college, they were in their teens or twenties, not being exposed to the real world. When going back to college as a professional, a few mistakes can be avoided.
Title: Lectures Are Not Learning Content: Most of us believe that lecture time is learning time, but the fact is that they are only effective when one is already familiar with the material being taught. Introduction of new concepts during a one hour lecture does not make us grasp it fully, but the hard work is to be done later when we sit and grasp the concepts that were discussed. It is best to relax and listen to the lectures with an open mind.
Title: Note-Taking: The Real Use Content: Badly taken notes easily become redundant and useless.Real and useful note-taking is when we note down the names and brief explanations of new concepts, like author names, references, theoretical names and concepts, instead of copying everything on the slide.It is great to write down the questions that come in our minds, something which is often neglected.Colored or coded notes, that are marked in different shapes or blocks help ease the looking up part later, and also while studying for an exam.One can also use the phone recorder to help in note-taking.
Title: Going Off-Syllabus Content: A University is not just about memorizing facts and concepts, especially when one is already a professional. Your deep learnings can go beyond the syllabus, setting off new directions and building upon a unique set of knowledge that can take you into uncharted territory and eventually enviable success.If you are going off-topic, take it as a sign of learning and exploration.
