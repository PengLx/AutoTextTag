Title: Stick With The Plan Content: Most training plans become hard, and difficult to stick to after a while.Some sure-fire tips to stick to a rough and tough training plan, sailing through the low-motivation days:Pick something fun and start slow.Just show up.Don't go alone.Don't rely on willpower.Be patient.
Title: Picking Something Fun Content: You are more likely to keep doing an activity that you enjoy.It shouldn't be a daily fight against yourself.Being consistent needs doing what you like doing, not something that you find miserable.Avoid physical or mental burnout.
Title: Showing Up Content: To change your mental state, you need to change your physical state.Your mood changes based on the action you are performing.Action is the biggest motivation.Show up and get started, and the rest is easy.
Title: Donâ€™t Go Alone Content: If you have people around you, they will provide constant motivation, as opposed to following the path of training alone.A group/a friend with similar fitness levels is ideal.People can double their workout duration and intensity if they have a slightly fitter person as a partner.
Title: Relying on Willpower Content: The risk of skipping a workout increases when you rely only on willpower or even if you start to overthink about the subject.Trying to make it easy for you to do any activity (like already having the right shoes, or a packed gym bag ready to go) can eliminate friction and lead to a better turnout rate.Those who have zero willpower are better off with a coach.
Title: Patience Content: To attain mastery, and to really have a breakthrough, don't give up, be patient and continue your practice in the hard times.It will feel a lot less hard afterward.
