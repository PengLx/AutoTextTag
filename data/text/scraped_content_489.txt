Title: Rewards and dopamine Content: Our brains compute 3 things about reward: how much will we get, how soon will we get it, and how certain are we that we will in fact get it.And it’s when the probability of a reward hovers at around 50% that dopamine flow is maximal. When the probability of getting it is as high as the probability of not getting it — the point of maximum uncertainty. That’s what turns us on the most.

The sweet spot knows you, it finds you. It adjusts to you.
