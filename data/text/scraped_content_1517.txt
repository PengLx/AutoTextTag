Title: 4 common mistakes that can trip you up Content: Monumentalizing the Trivial. Place a limit on how long you're willing to spend addressing the issue. When the time ends, make your choice and move on.Dredging Sunk Costs. Estimate how much the decision would take in total to follow through. If the cost is higher than the benefit, change your decision. Drowning in Data.  Identify less than 10 pieces of relevant data that will have a strong impact on your decision's outcome. Then forget everything else.Do-or-Die Mentality. Realize that every decision is temporary. Use an overall decision-making strategy that stretches over time, not that imagines each moment to be the most critical one for the business.
