Title: Hedonism: The Reality Content: Long being associated with frivolity, mindless pleasure-seeking, gluttony and danger, hedonism was initially a fairly simple concept in ancient greek philosophy. Hedonism at its very core, states that pleasure is in itself a worthwhile pursuit.Pleasure is conspicuously missing from our productivity-oriented culture and is to be looked at with a new light.
Title: The Good Life Content: Philosophy Professor Catherine Wilson talks about pleasure being fundamental in our ability to live a good life, and how a fine balance has to be maintained between current pleasure(indulgence) and future pleasure, which is life planning.If we work ourselves endlessly,  trying to hoard wealth, life will be over in a blink of an eye.
Title: Hedonism Reloaded Content: Apart from a more justified and gender-neutral definition of hedonism, the definition of luxury and pleasure itself is changing.  What was once enjoyable seems like a waste of time now, while economic instability and low wages do not allow for a hedonistic lifestyle to be a reality for many of us.Pleasure seeking needs to be viewed as a positive, life-giving pursuit in these times where everyone is striving hard to make ends meet.
