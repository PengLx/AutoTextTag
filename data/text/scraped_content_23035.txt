Title: Experience vs Beauty Content: While searching for happiness, one often confuses something beautiful with something that would make one feel happy. While beauty captivates us, the actual experience makes us far happier than the physical beauty.A beautiful home, for instance, cannot guarantee that the experience of living there would be a good one.
Title: The Influence Of Appearance Content: External beauty and pleasing appearance often influence our perception, and we believe that this would dictate our experience after we attain it.The day-to-day experience of living in a particular place cannot be judged by its outer beauty. Our relationships and social health are more important than architecture.
