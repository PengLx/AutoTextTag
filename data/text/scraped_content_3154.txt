Title: The purpose of assessments Content: Good assessment programs use a range of strategies and tasks, in varying contexts, to understand what students know and can do.Tasks must also be “fit for purpose”.  A task assessing base knowledge will look different from one assessing creativity.
Title: Exams focus on breadth Content: In most disciplines, there are specific bodies of knowledge that students are expected to learn.Exams enable assessors to test the students’ breadth of understanding of topics.
Title: Exams enhance learning Content: Studying for exams deepens learning.  Searching through one's memory and retrieving the relevant information strengthens the memory pathway.Learning is particularly strong when students self-test rather than passively learning by rote.
