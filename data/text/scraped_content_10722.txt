Title: The habit of shaking hands Content: Taking into account the current situation created by the new virus, disease experts state that we should all consider removing handshakes from our habits from now on, as they could only increase the chances of transmitting the virus. However, this decision is not so easy to be taken, as shaking hands has a high social value in the business environment worldwide: it shows good intentions, trust and follow-through. 
Title: Giving up on handshakes  Content: While shaking hands reveals the need to connect with the other and be socially engaged, several disease experts are encouraging us to find a substitute that would endanger less our health throughout periods of pandemics and not only. For instance, greetings such as simply stating how much of a pleasure it is to meet a person could actually do the trick. 
Title: Adapting our social habits Content: While disease experts support the idea of removing the handshakes from our cultural customs, several University professors claim that individuals are surely able to adept their customs, even if these have been practiced for generations to come. Therefore, giving up or just adjusting the handshake, should be no major issue for our civilization.
