Title: SURROUND YOURSELF WITH POSITIVE PEOPLE Content:  You are what you are sometimes because of those around you, the environment you grew up in .Actually, you will have it all in you ,but still can’t see it because those around you aren’t helping you to let it out, instead of helping you and motivating you to do better.You spent most of your time with negative people who have bad influence on you ,on your thoughts and your mindset ,they will never tell you to dream big because they don’t know how to do it themselves .Moreover negative people are dealt with many issues,because they are not able to see the positivity in themselves.But rest assured positive people,with a positive attitude will have great impact on you and your life.They will change your thoughts,your lifestyle even your attitude,spending time with kind of people make your dreams a success , those people will motivate and inspire you to follow your dreams,they will even help you in every bad situation you might be faced with, they will be there for you all the time..A positive person,always smiles , shares his smile and makes the world a better place.Life is a roller coaster for many of us but to rise above this ups and downs we need to have the best people around us that will help us move on positively..I personally have issues in my life but I’ve got the best people to share them with and that am sure will help me rise up again ..You will have many freinds but not all will have a positive mindset, so then cut the rest off because if you don’t you will end up just like them ..Note this “A positive person has the best qualities and the negative ones too but the negative one never gets to realise them”You are what you are and that’s good but you can be what you want when you have the best people around you…
