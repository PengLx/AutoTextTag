Title: A Wordpress’ developer life Content: After helping with dinner, cleaning up, and more family time, I’ll jump back on the computer around 8:00, and finish up any tasks that are lingering for the day, as well as write my notes for tomorrow and report the day’s work in my X-Team journal .Yes, the technology (PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS/JS) and methodology that it uses are a bit old, mainly because they are trying to be backward-compatible, but WordPress has come a long way in many areas. The new Gutenberg editor allows developers to create fancy, new React-based blocks for users to help create their sites, while WP-CLI allows developers to quickly perform admin and site tasks from the command line.I then decided to save my current progress, but try a new approach as well and see where that got me. Near the end of the workday, and after creating several LEFT JOIN’s and WHERE clauses that contained MySQL functions, and a combination of a lot of trial and error from both of the paths I tried, I solved the problem and was able to retrieve the correct data. Woohoo!I believe the key to a good balance of beautifully-written code and moving swiftly through a project is time and task management. If you can schedule out your work before you start and include a healthy margin of extra time for bugs, you know exactly how long you can work to make your code shine before you need to move on to the next task, so the project isn’t delayed.
