Title: The Right Amount Of Work Content: The World Health Organization(WHO) recently recognized the symptoms of workplace burnout, with too much work wreaking havoc on our mental health, all across the world.Surprisingly, not working too has similar mental health effects, and there is a middle ground, an effective dose of work that promotes well being and increases life satisfaction.
Title: Eight Hours A Week Content: An extensive study shows that just eight hours a week is enough for the average worker to generate significant mental health and well-being benefits.Working between one to eight hours per week resulted in decreased risk of mental health issues, especially among people recently unemployed. Working has some intangible benefits, called psychological vitamins,  like social contact, structured routine, shared goals, enforced activity, variety and a sense of identity. Spending more time at work does not lead to an increase in the benefits.
