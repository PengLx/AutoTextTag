Title: 15 minutes a day for making changes Content: Devote at least 15 minutes a day to your change.Even if it’s just a walk around your neighborhood, one less cigarette, reading an inspirational article, do it. Mix it up, too. No one wants to be stuck doing some tedious workout regime.
Title: Fork over the truth Content: Behavior modification teaches us that we repeat behaviors that make us feel good.What’s your payoff for not changing?Until the goal becomes larger than the payoff, you’re always going to choose feeling good over feeling uncomfortable.
Title: Set realistic goals Content: Start with one behavior at a time.Instead of concentrating on losing 20 pounds in 20 days, for example, make a goal to simply begin by eating five fruits and vegetables a day. 
Title: Never eliminate. Replace Content: If your goal includes eliminating a specific behavior, it must be replaced with a new behavior if you want permanent change.If we don’t substitute a behavior, we end up creating a big void that leads to obsessive thinking. And that eventually will lead to falling back into old patterns.
Title: Find support Content: We all need encouragement and support throughout our journey of change.For you, maybe that’s a friend to hold you accountable or a group that is like-minded in where they want to go.
