Title: Labelling Unnamed Emotions Content: Emotions have been labelled and categorized for our convenience, but often we are unable to accurately identify what exactly we are feeling.Certain mixtures of emotions, which may have names we haven’t heard before, like the emotion acedia, first mentioned in Ancient Greece, describing our current state of procrastination, restlessness, listlessness and uncertainty.
Title: Acedia: The Noonday Demon Content: Early Christians describe acedia as a train of thought(a noonday demon) arising out of a solitary, monastic existence. Boredom, anxiety, listlessness and lack of concentration go into the cauldron of acedia.Emotional expressions can change over time, due to cultural, moral and social changes.Self-introspection and self-recognition of our own ‘constellation’ of feelings, sensations and mindsets, can help us emotionally regulate ourselves, and move inwards towards tranquility.
