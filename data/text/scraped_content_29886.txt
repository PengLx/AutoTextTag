Title: The Pen And Paper Content: Even in this digital age, when automation is in full force and being swift on the keyboard is a crucial skill, using your hand and pencil is still on top of the charts for cognitive learning.Every student of all age groups has one cognitive toolkit with them: a pen and a notebook, to be able to take notes by hand.  Handwritten notes are an important and powerful practice to infuse information in the brain, making it easier to retrieve information when required.
Title: Taking Notes By Hand: Better Brain Processing Content: Keyboarding information verbatim into the laptop does not involve any cognitive engagement like concept and vocabulary mapping, paraphrasing, summarizing or organizing as manual, by-hand note taking does. When we use a pen and paper, we are creating notes in the real sense, crafting and designing them by hand, which aids brain processing.The cognitive demands of note-taking, taking into consideration speed and legibility makes the process slightly challenging, and creates stronger memory.
Title: Pictorial Learnings Content: Handwritten notes, letters, diaries and journals are an artful, reflective activity that aids learning, while becoming enduring over time. Doodling and drawing illustrations also help us describe our learnings to others, strengthening and aiding visual learning in us as well as those who we teach.
