Title: Determine who is involved in the brainstorm Content: Identify the roles and expertise you want, and then find people who fit that description. This will help you ensure that the group you bring together is more diverse, bringing a range of different backgrounds and perspectives to the problem-solving task.Prior to the pandemic, it was a hurdle for people with broad and diverse perspectives to be in the same room, physically together.  With remote work, it is easier to bring in people having a range of different backgrounds and perspectives to sit together remotely and brainstorm on the task at hand.
Title: The groupthink theory Content: It shows that, during part of the sessions that involves idea generation, individuals think differently about a problem if they work alone. But when you bring the group together to generate ideas, they tend to think alike, converging on a common solution.So start your brainstorming process by having each person generate potential solutions on their own, or perhaps have them work in small groups to think about possibilities.
Title: The construal-level theory Content: Distance, whether physical, time-oriented, or social, makes the human mind think in an abstract manner. This is known as the construal-level theory. Being physically distant from the problem at hand makes our viewpoint abstract, which can help us provide a birds-eye view of the problem and associate it with our own area of expertise, forming useful analogies and connections.
