Title: The Zettelkasten System Of Productivity Content: The Zettelkasten way or the ‘slip box’ method was pioneered by Niklas Luhmann, is an always-on, filing system that one can use to categorize and ‘slip’ any new insight or idea in a separate file or cabinet. With this method, any new idea or insight now has a readymade home where it can be placed easily, with the growing collection facilitating new projects and cross-connections.
Title: Zettelkasten: An Indexing System For Ideas Content: The way to collect ideas using the Zettelkasten Method is to use a branching card system, where numbers and letters are used to ‘address’ or pinpoint the sequence as well as the branching hierarchy of an idea.A card address can be 1/1, or ½, or 1/2a based on the idea and connecting ideas it has.Another method is to add references at the bottom of the cards, jotting down the addresses of ‘related’ ideas, making cross-referencing easier.This method is similar to hypertext and URLs of the digital age, though in a completely analogue form.
Title: Zettelkasten Method In The Digital Age Content: Many note-taking apps can mimic the functionality of the Zettelkasten system but have certain limitations like few backup options, and loss of insight links in case of a shutdown of the app. Others offer pristine functionality of the idea filing and linking system but have the same proprietary and database concerns.The best way is to go manual and build a word file using hypertext links, notes and references.One can try a mix and match approach, making sure that one is able to:quickly start a new idea or note.quickly link two or more notes.able to retrieve a note easily.is synced and is usable in multiple devices.
