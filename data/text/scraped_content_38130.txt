Title: Zero: The Starting Point Towards Infinity Content: Many of us striving for success start from almost nothing: we have zero customers, zero fans, zero momentum, zero bank balance and zero evidence of ever being successful.The good news is that success is not that far away, and you can bridge the gap of zero to ‘highly successful’ in a matter of five years, due to the momentum that is built in the coming weeks, months and quarters.One needs to be resilient and keep investing time and energy towards the chosen path.
Title: From Zero To Hero Content: The journey from zero to hero is a lonely one, as every other person will put something negative in your brain, and only one a few in thousands will fuel your fire and inject positivity in you.Once you have chosen your path, you don’t have to convince yourself anymore, or be demotivated by others, and can simply work towards your goals. You have to protect your dream, and block the noise of society while pursuing it.
Title: Seize The Day and Your Life Content: There isn’t any life security and everything is risky. Job security is a myth and one has to strive for oneself.So seize the day and stop taking life too seriously, not worrying about what others will say because life is now too short to worry about others. Just go for your dream while you are still alive.
