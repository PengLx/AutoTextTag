Title: Motivation at the moribund shine  Content: You know, the articles that make it seem as though to be successful, there is this innate willpower you must possess in order to get up at 4 a.m. and crush the day before even stepping foot into the office.What drives us to be motivated are specific emotional states: feeling grateful, having compassion for not only others but ourselves, and developing a sense of pride in what we do.The alarm begins to ring at 6 a.m. and instead of reacting, I decide to tap into these three emotions. I begin by taking a deep breath and acknowledging the fact that I am tired, it has been a long week, and I have a right to feel this way, it’s normal—that's compassion .I then remind myself that I am thankful to see this day because it is yet another opportunity to start over and another opportunity to work on my goals—that's gratitude .
Title: Motivation emotions part 2/ shine  Content: Instead of writing down the same items each day—like being grateful for your job, or the roof over your head—try writing about the person who smiled at you on the train or the fact that the weather is finally warming up after a long cold winter.The first part of self-compassion: Paying attention to your self-talk. In difficult or unfavorable situations, your immediate response may often be “ugh, I’m so dumb,” or “wow, you messed up again." But try to counter that thinking with something more affirming. “Yes, I made a mistake but I’m only human it will be okay. Let me think of how I can fix or learn from this.”Pride isn’t always about the big outcomes, but sometimes the process that got you there in the first place.
