Title: Movement during the speech Content: Harnessing energy and erratic movements while talking in front of an audiencewill give the impression that you are calm and in command.There's a lot of good research that suggests that we project influence and status on people who aren't fidgeting around a lot when they are talking to people.
Title: Preparation before the speech Content: Find your center, perhaps with a breathing exercise or five minutes of meditation to calm the inner storm, and prepare.When there's an intense underlying emotion beneath the desire to communicate something, we tend to hyper-express a messy tangle of words that fail to capture what we're really trying to say.
Title: Being authentic when giving a speech Content: You don't want to give the impression that you're acting.People will figure out when you're trying to be someone that you're not.
Title: Record your progress Content: Tape your next presentation or meeting to see where you're missing the mark, and get somebody to give you feedback.Keep at it. Presidents Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush were considered blazingly bad public speakers at first, but dramatically and steadily improved with continued practice.
