Title: Better Your Storytelling With Emotion And Reaction Content: Though a cartoon is two-dimensional, to make an emotional connection with the audience characters need action and re-action. Walt Disney had his artists focus on learning that.Too often presenters are so caught up in what they are going to say they never take time to add the “element” of great delivery which is expressing the emotion and reaction of our characters.
Title: Keep The Audience’s Perception In Mind Content: Walt Disney realized that to tell the best stories he had to invest in teaching his artists how to be the best if he wanted his movies to be the best. They then invested more and created their own schools.We need to be less concerned about how we look at our stories and instead focus on the images we draw in the minds of our audience.  We use words to do that and they need just enough detail to let the minds of the audience to paint an image but not so much that we confuse the image in their mind.
