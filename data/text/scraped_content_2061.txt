Title: Breathing Is Everything Content: How you breathe will dictate everything from the type of athlete you are, to how you sleep, to how your body feels and looks. At the core of breathing is connecting with our core. Our breath does not originate in our lungs or in our chests, but from deep within.
Title: Slow It Down Content: Being proficient at anything at full speed takes the willingness and patience to first go slowly, literally and figuratively.Any professional athlete will tell you that the ritualistic nature of slowing down your craft is the key to success in that craft. You have to walk before you can run.
Title: Words Only Have the Power We Give Them Content: Words inspire, words inform, and words can destroy - if we let them. The martial arts will teach you not to react to other’s problems, but to pay attention to your own. Learn not to react to words that are meant for harm.
Title: Awareness Is Everything Content: The ability to be present in a given circumstance means the difference between success and failure and potentially life and death. Nothing brings you to the present moment quite like a fight, whether it’s a practice fight or a real one. The difference from a practice like meditation where you slow down and find awareness, is that the martial arts not only slows down, it speeds way up.
Title: The Greatest Battles Are Fought Within Content: Even in actual fights, the greatest obstacle we face is our own fear, our own breath, or our own tension. Battles will be won when we’re willing to face ourselves.
Title: The Journey Is What Matters Content: In our culture, we tend to focus on outcomes. Winning versus losing. In the martial arts, process is growth, regardless of outcome. As we grow old we need not stop growing.
