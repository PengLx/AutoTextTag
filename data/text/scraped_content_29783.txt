Title: Trying To Be Less Awkward Content: No one looks forward to awkward moments, as they can be panic-inducing. So we end up desperately following certain social rules to minimize awkwardness, like ensuring conversational silence isnâ€™t more than four seconds or having certain formulated ways to end a phone conversation.
Title: Self-Consciousness In Awkward Situations Content: Being nervous and anxious makes us turn our attention inward, thus becoming extremely self-conscious of what we say and how we appear.Social anxiety also makes us become increasingly nervous when we notice the subtle audience reactions or the body language of the people who are around us.By becoming extremely self-conscious in awkward situations we only overwhelm our minds to the point of becoming unable to focus on one thing (just like we are not fully focused on our conversation while driving, and vice-versa).
Title: In Awkward Moments, Focus On The Others Content: When we focus on others during a conversation, we shift our attention outward and become at ease, relatively. Our exaggerated self-consciousness is gone and we become less awkward.Keeping our mind on the goal and not on the process makes us avoid the self-focus vortex, and it also helps to take a deep breath and lighten up.
