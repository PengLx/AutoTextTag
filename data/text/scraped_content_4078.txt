Title: The Elixir of Life Content: Sleep, something which people take for granted, much like oxygen, is the elixir of life.Insomniacs must know that sleep is natural, and normal, with each of us having the capability to sleep well.
Title: Tips for Sleeping Content: Get up at the same time every morning.Write affirmations to tell yourself that your body knows how to sleep.Don't involve your over-thinking mind too much.Use your bed is for sleep and sex only.Don't lie awake for more than 20 minutes on the bed, and if you can't sleep, get up and try to do some calming activity like folding laundry.
Title: The Enemy of Sleep Content: Our body will take care of itself if left on its own.It is our mind which is the culprit, running like a motor, inducing low-grade anxiety inside us.Sleep is not something you have to do, but something which happens naturally to you.If an insomniac forgets that he is an insomniac, he will have a good night's sleep.
