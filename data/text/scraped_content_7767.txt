Title: Self-love Content: It seems that recently the idea of 'self' as in 'self-love', 'self-made', 'self-care' etc. has been gaining more and more importance especially in the Western culture. While the self can be perceived as both an internal and external entity connected to the outside world, one should be aware of the fact that the we learn to love ourselves only by being loved by others and vice versa.
Title: Self-love vs. other types of self Content: Whenever you think about self-love, try picturing yourself making a mistake. Forgiving your own mistakes instead of overreacting to them is what self-love looks like. Sell-love is deeply connected to our relationship to the ones around us, as we are definitely shaped by our experiences. On the other hand, we have what we call self-sufficiency and self-reliance, terms that define the relationship one has with himself or herself, without involving anybody else.
