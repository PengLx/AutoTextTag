Title: Finding a balance Content: We read that we should eat a balanced diet, live a balanced life, and seek a good work/family balance without defining balance.Balance is the taking of appropriate action when circumstances dictate so as to maintain equilibrium.
Title: No mass-producible solutions Content: It is important to understand that balance is relative: the focus of balance is always going to be different from person to person. There is no one size fits all.For example, what a balanced diet means for one person may be entirely different for another. Both diets may be healthy, but it is the context that makes it so. 
Title: Finding a sense of balance Content: Finding a sense of harmony may turn to dissonance and loss of balance if you continue to try and hold on and freeze that moment.Life is one thing after another. We live in a constantly changing environment. Balance is learning to adjust appropriately to the external environment.
