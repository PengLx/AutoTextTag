Title: Quality time Content: While the desire for quality time comes from a good place, it is not part of reality.One side of us is influenced by movies and wants everything to be special. But that ideal is almost impossible to live up to and often results in disappointment. 
Title: Every day is special Content: Instead of wishing for quality time, every minute can be quality time.  It's using the time between the busy moments to hang out, and work out, and do things together.
Title: The best quality times Content: Driving your children around should not be seen as an inconvenience. It is a moment between moments where you have an opportunity to connect and have fun. It is where you can share and learn things you'd never know otherwise. This is true for other relationships. These in-between moments, in a car, waiting for a delayed plane, allow for conversations that never would have happened otherwise. We get our best times when we look at the moments we have right in front of us.
