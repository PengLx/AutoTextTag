Title: Multitasking Content: Those that do multitask the most are the worst at it. Productivity is defined as, “having the power to produce.” By that definition, multitasking is the opposite of productivity because you are more prone to distractions and have less power to produce what you need to produce.
Title: Not Getting Enough Rest Content: When we get tired, we make mistakes, which means more time and money must be put into correcting those mistakes.When we get tired, it takes us longer to do things, costing more time and money to do something that could get done in less time if we were fully awake.
Title: Doing Everything Yourself Content: Either one of two problems: you don’t like delegating tasks, or you’re having trouble prioritizing which tasks deserve your time.Figure out which tasks deserve your time the most (or those tasks that you do best), and outsource something that’s of low priority.
Title: You Don’t Have a Vision Content: This isa vision for what you actually want to accomplish.Visualize what you want to get done that day or that week for some of the larger tasks.Instead of “write white paper”, you could “outline the white paper” or “write three pages of the white paper.” Writing the entire thing in one sitting may feel productive, but it’s a very tiring way to be productive.
