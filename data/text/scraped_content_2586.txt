Title: Limit the time spent reading news Content: “Headline anxiety” is a growing problem.One way to reduce the impact of the non-stop news cycle is to use screen-time trackers, available for most smartphones, to limit the time you spend reading or watching the news on your mobile.
Title: Turn off push notifications Content: If the urge to scroll is too strong to resist, then at least turning off your push notifications from news apps can stop you from being assailed with breaking events.
Title: Read the good news Content: If we focus on the bigger picture, such as the proportion of people living in extreme poverty halving in the past 20 years, it may be easier to remain optimistic.Seek another perspective. If you hear about something terrible, ask yourself: "if there had been a positive improvement, would I have heard about that?”
Title: Prioritize trusted news sources Content: It is now well known that social media can magnify the significance of fake news.Find your news instead, then, through verified and trusted publications.
Title: No news before bed Content: Research has shown that screen use before bed resets our internal clock and disrupts sleep, so reading the news onscreen before bed can make your mornings even more anxious and tiring. Even if we’ve read anxiety-inducing news during the day, sleep can restore us.
