Title: Prep with a power pose Content: 2 minutes of power posing - standing tall, holding your arms out or toward the sky, or standing like Superman, with your hands on hips - will dramatically increase your confidence.Try it before you step into a situation in which you know you'll feel nervous, insecure, or intimidated.
Title: When the going gets tough, start smiling Content: Frowning, grimacing, glowering, and other negative facial expressions send a signal to your brain that whatever you're doing is difficult. That causes your brain to send cortisol into your bloodstream, which raises your stress levels.Instead, force yourself to smile. It works.
Title: If you're confronted... Content: ...don't back away; just shift to a slight angle -so you're standing at an angle--much like models who almost never stand with their bodies square to the camera.And if you wish to appear less confrontational, approach the person and stand at a 45-degree angle (while still making direct eye contact, of course).
Title: Use props to engage Content: People who stand or sit with their arms crossed and heads tilted forward are naturally more resistant and defensive.To break this resistant pose, you can:Shake hands. Ask for their business card. Offer a drink.ask questions that involve raising hands. Pass around relevant items. Find a way to get people to stand or change seats.
