Although the Mexican Army was outnumbered two to one, they repelled attacks by the French army on the city of Puebla.Four days later, on May 9, 1862, Juárez declared Cinco de Mayo a national holiday.Even though the French eventually defeated the Mexican Army, the battle of Puebla proved that Mexico was a formidable opponent worthy of international respect.
