Title: Algorithms And Bias Content: Algorithms are being used in self-driving cars, social media curation (based on our engagement patterns) and of course, shopping recommendations. We solely rely on algorithms, (unconsciously or even unintentionally) in many of our decisions, and fall victim to human bias, which is often baked right inside the algorithms.
Title: Agents Of Discrimination Content: As there is no evidence-based process or manual fact check in algorithms, given its scale and sheer size of individuals involved, it tends to be an agent of discrimination, perpetuating old injustices and prejudice.Algorithms that have a meaningful impact on our lives need to be dealt with scrutiny and thorough analysis.
Title: Garbage In, Garbage Out Content: Big data does not always look at the quality of data and assumes that more data is good, less data is bad. The inevitably of data being measured by ‘quantity’ and not ‘quality’ creates a ‘data gap’, where false assumptions can come inside the algorithms.Example: Many medical studies use a ‘reference person’ which has an age of 25 to 30 and weighs about 70 kg, a flawed way to represent the whole of humanity.
Title: Limits Of Algorithms Content: There are limits to what can be ‘quantified’ as human bias and errors of judgement are all over our historical archives, and the same data is being used by ‘big data’ to create models of behaviour.Example: If the data about criminals is being analyzed by computers, the skin color and gender factors can creep into the newly-created algorithm, as it may already be lopsided and biased.
Title: Leaving Half Of The Population Content: We have to acknowledge how diverse the world really is and understand that many algorithms constructed using our online behaviour will exclude about half of the population, which are not even online yet.The quality of the data is crucial to help us not repeat the biases of the past.
