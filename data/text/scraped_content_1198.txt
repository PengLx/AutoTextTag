Title: Pros of the KonMari Method Content: Decluttering in one shot allows for immediate transformation: If you tidy a little at a time, you would tidy forever because you wouldn't see the drastic results.Sorting by category instead of by room can save you time.The emphasis is keeping only what "sparks joy":Will help you better decide what to keep, and also give you a greater appreciation for what you have.You let go of your stuff with gratitude for the usefulness they served.
Title: Cons of the KonMari Method Content: This process may not be realistic for larger spaces or families:This guide is written from the point of view of a single woman in her early 30's who lives in a small flat in Japan.Category sorting may not be as effective if you have a family.Untagging clothes and immediately hanging them in your closet doesn't always make sense.The book doesn't address how to deal with children's toys. 
Title: KonMari is not full-proof Content: If you're single, or a couple with a small pet in a tiny apartment it may work. But if you're a large family in a larger space you'll have to pick and choose what works otherwise outsource some of the work.
