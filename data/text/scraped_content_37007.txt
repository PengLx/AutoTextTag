Title: Hello Content: It's a scientific study I've been conducting on myself since the late 90s. I'm here to report on the results: It works wonders . You wake up when you need to wake up, unless you have to catch a flight or drive the kids to school. Eventually, though, your sleep schedule sets itself and you don't need an alarm. Like, ever again.Ironically, this goes against everything I've seen recently about how to boost your productivity. A recent WSJ report profiled a few early risers , some whom start at 4 a.m to get a jump on the day, suggesting in no uncertain terms that it can help you get more done. A few weeks ago, I wrote about how Marissa Mayer used to work 130 hours per week ; Elon Musk has also stated how many hours he thinks entrepreneurs should work in order to be a success, suggesting around 100 per week .I'm surprised the WSJ report didn't mention any of this this. First, new research by the National Sleep Foundation says a lack of sleep over a longer period of time creates a "sleep debt " which is a bit like having a high interest credit card. Eventually, you have to pay it back, which is something Chase doesn't always explain. Your body is unique, but on average the NSF also found that adults need 7-9 hours of sleep per night."If you don't sleep, you don't fly..." says the TED talk speaker, Russell Foster.
