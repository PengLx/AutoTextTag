Title: Activation energy Content: Every habit or behavior has an activation energy. The more difficult or complex a behavior, the higher the activation energy required to start it.The smaller the habit, the less energy you need to start.
Title: Smaller habits are more sustainable Content: Big goals often require big activation energies. And you get stuck dreaming about life-changing outcomes, instead of taking action.Stick with smaller habits. They require smaller activation energies and that makes them more sustainable.
Title: Environment design = catalyst for building better habits   Content:  Environments where we live and work influence our behaviors. Catalysts lower the activation energy required to start a new habit. And optimizing you environment is one way to catalyze habits: in the right environment, every habit is easier.
Title: Even simple habits have intermediate steps Content: And each intermediate step has its own activation energy. Examine your habits closely and eliminate the intermediate steps with the highest activation energy(i.e. the biggest sticking points). Your habits will be easier to accomplish this way.
