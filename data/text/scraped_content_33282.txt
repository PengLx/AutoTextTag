Title: Resisting The Traps Of Structure Content: Many of us would prefer to have a life filled with freedom and choice, rather than a fixed, imposed or structured routine. The structure feels good but after a while, there is an urge to rebel against it, as it feels like a chain tied to the leg.The mess that is created when one rebels against a self-created structure is actually crucial for our growth. Whatever we are doing in our lives, managing, leading or creating, cannot be fruitful without structure. 
Title: Creating Sacred Blocks Of Time Content: Self-care is important but often overlooked in our daily grind. It is good to create a structure that includes meditation, breathing exercise, walks in nature, reading, exercise, project work, and creative pursuits.Block some time during the day for such activities, like small bubbles of space that provide you with relief from the gruelling schedule.
Title: Relax Towards Your Sacred Block Content: When the feeling of resisting the sacred blocks of time comes, we need to practice appreciation, relaxation, gratitude and joy and try to enjoy the structure that is created.Example: If you chose jogging at 6:00 AM as a sacred block of time for your self-care, try to appreciate how beautiful the weather would be outside, and how good you could feel out in the open.
