Title: Equilibrium and change Content: Our daily routines are governed by the balance between our environment, our genetic potential and many other forces. All of these forces are interacting each day, but we rarely notice how they shape our behaviors.That is, until we try to make a change. - James Clear
Title: The myth of Radical Change Content: The myth of radical change and overnight success is pervasive in our culture. Any quest for rapid growth contradicts every stabilizing force in our lives.Remember, the natural tendency of life is to find stability.
Title: The Paradox of Behavior Change Content: In order for change to last, we must work with the fundamental forces in our lives, not against them. Thus, the best way to achieve a new level of equilibrium is not with radical change, but through small wins each day. - James Clear
Title: The Optimal Rate of Growth focuses on small wins Content: When you accumulate small wins and focus on one percent improvements, you nudge equilibrium forward. It is like building muscle:If the weight is too light, your muscles will atrophy. If the weight is too heavy, you'll end up injured. But if the weight is just a touch beyond your normal, then your muscles will adapt to the new stimulus and equilibrium will take a small step forward. - James Clear
