Title: Beliefs Are Tattooed In The Mind Content: A University Of Iowa research states that once people form their beliefs, they are not likely to change their minds on the face of new information that clearly proves that their long-held beliefs are completely wrong. They are far more likely to go on protecting and fighting for their beliefs.Even if the new information is extremely compelling and the person has no choice but to change their opinion, it is a temporary change that reverts back fast.
Title: Feedback And Other's People's Opinions Content: Other people's opinions and feedback play a larger role than factual proof in debunking the existing thought patterns, beliefs and opinions of an individual. While trying to tell right from wrong, like a multiple choice question, what other people are choosing plays an important role in the final choice.Being an expert in a particular field also has the reverse effect, as one is less inclined to learn anything new, preferring the safety and comfort of the existing set of knowledge.
Title: Changing People's Minds: Building A Bridge Content: A direct, upfront message aimed at debunking an existing belief has little effect on swaying an opinion, but if the message first presents the old belief and the justifications behind it, followed by the facts that try to refute the same, a bridge is created, and the impact is greater.
