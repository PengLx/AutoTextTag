Title: Bilinguals Content: According to a new study, the people that can speak two languages frequently, develop cognitive flexibility, due to their brains getting rewired.Bilinguals can switch back and forth between the two languages effortlessly, something known as code-switching.
Title: Time Perception Content: Different cultures have different perceptions about time.The Mandarin language, for example, places time in a vertical axis, with next week becoming down week, and last week becoming up week.These differences in language have a psycho-physical effect in bilinguals and change the way the same person experiences the passage of time, depending on which language the brain is operating in.
Title: Flexible Brain Shifting Content: Studies on Bilinguals prove that language can affect our most basic senses, our time perception, visual perception, and our emotions.The flexible brain-shifting of bilinguals also aids in their learning, multitasking abilities, and mental well-being.
