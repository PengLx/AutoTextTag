Personal Development
Title:  Content: At first, sticking to a daily morning routine is tough  . So, you need to know why you’re doing it. The author and speaker Simon Sinek said, “Working hard for something we do not care about is called stress, working hard for something we love is called passion.” If you don’t know why you’re working hard to develop a morning routine, it’s like you’ll get stressed, burn out, and quit. However, if you’re passionate about why  you’re getting up at 5 am every morning, everything is suddenly much easier. Make sure to define your “why” clearly.Then, create ways to remind you of your reasons. Put notes everywhere, set reminders on your phone, recite a mantra – drill it in.
