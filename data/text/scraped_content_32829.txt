Title: About limitations  Content: There’s no limit to our limitations in life. Our dreams, desires, and usefulness can be frustrated by physical frailties or disabilities of a thousand kinds—by financial problems, by geographical barriers, by legal restrictions, by family considerations, and more.But you can do whatever God calls you to do despite your limitations, for He gave His Spirit to Jesus without limit, and we are the extension of Jesus in this world.In practical terms, that means we should stop worrying about what wecan’t do, and start doing what wecan do. We should do it with enthusiasm, as working for the Lord and not for men (Colossians 3:23). We should wave off discouragement, and trust God to finish what He has begun in us.If we see only the problems, we will be defeated; but if we see the possibilities in the problems, we can have victory.
