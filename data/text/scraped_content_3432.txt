Title: Put things into the world Content: Your work is your greatest marketing tool. So make things and put them into the world.The more you make, the higher its quality, and the more willing you are to share it with the world, the more people will discover and spread the word about you.
Title: Help people Content: Selfish doesn’t spread.Not only is it the right thing to do, but it will get you noticed by the people you help and the people they know.
Title: Overdeliver Content: Nobody tells anybody else about the person who did a “good enough” job on the work they hired them to do.
Title: Respond to everyone Content: If someone reaches out, respond to them.That doesn't mean you have to have an answer to every question you get asked or that you have to agree to every request you receive. You just have to respond.
Title: When people mention you Content: Acknowledge everyone who mentions you.Many people and companies want to better market themselves while they simultaneously ignore their existing audience.
Title: Share what you learn Content: When you share your journey, it makes people want to come along for the ride.You may know something, but there are millions of people who haven’t learned it yet and would love to.
Title: Teach what you know Content: Your knowledge is an asset that becomes infinitely more valuable when you share it.Teaching not only attracts an appreciative crowd and creates opportunities, but it also unlocks a deeper understanding of your subject matter for you in the process.
