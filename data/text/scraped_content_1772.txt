Title: Change your route Content: If you have a bad or overly stressful day at work, take the long way home.First half of your journey: turn the radio off and think about what you have to accomplish at work and how you will execute.Second half of the journeyturn on whatever music you like, talk radio and begin the process of thinking about things outside of work.
Title: Vent Content: Once you get home after work, give yourself a 15-minute window to let it out.You should set this up in advance with your partner/family members/ friends but leave the time limit at 15 minutes. During that time, they have to simply listen and let you get it out. After that, you must agree that work is over.
Title: Keep electronics off Content: If you don’t need to work, keep the electronics off.Don’t login just because you are curious. You will find reasons to email people or start completing tasks.Occasionally we all have to work at night or on the weekends. The key here is to set an expectation when honestly important projects arise.
Title: Questions first Content: When you get home, immediately ask how your partner's day went and listen.Many times their response is enough to get you to think of family tasks and break you away from work. In addition, you will probably earn some points for engaging them in the conversation.
Title: Survival Content: Your workplace will survive without you.Remember this as you choose where to spend time. If it is after hours and you haven’t turned off your phone, you have to resist the urge to get involved in something that isn’t really ultra-critical.
