Title: We Lack Commitment Content: No matter what we tell ourselves, we are not committed fully towards most things. We tend to be different people, committing to change our diet, exercise or start on a certain goal, only to become someone different and get distracted, or simply procrastinate.We are not fully committed to ourselves or even to other people.We let ourselves and others down break promises, and this is affecting us and everyone around us.
Title: Effects of Being Uncommitted Content: Some effects of not being committed:We lose trust in ourselves and create a negative self-image.We tend to shrink and hide in our comfort zones.We lose the trust of our friends and family.We see that people don't trust us and feel guilty.
Title: Start Being Committed Content: Ignite your committed self:Observe and realize that your commitment levels need to be corrected.Check your true desire to commit, if it feels right, and if you have space and energy to uphold and sustain the commitment.See if you can bet something substantial to uphold this commitment.Take action and create a winning environment around you.Start with a relatively small commitment.Do whatever it takes to never break a promise to yourself again.
