Title: Teams that do Product Discovery vs. Product Delivery Content: Marty Cagan advises product teams to act as one single cross-functional team, responsible for both discovery and delivery. The team performs these two core activities,discovery and delivery, continuously.It is an anti-pattern to split into two different groups: a Discovery Team and a Delivery Team.
Title: Product Discovery and Product Delivery responsabilities inside a team Content: Naturally, the product manager and product designer will spend most of their time on discovery, while the engineers will spend most of their time on delivery.But you want to make sure that each member of the product team is engaged in both activities.
Title: Separating Product Discovery and Product Delivery inside a team Content: Bad example that happens often: the product manager believes it’s her job to define the product, and then hand-off “the requirements” to the designer and engineers to implement.Fundamentally we want to avoid having one person or groupobtainthe learnings, and then have to “hand-off” what they learned for another group to execute on.The group on the receiving end is inevitably going to feel like mercenaries, and not feel like their contributions on better potential solutions would be welcomed.
