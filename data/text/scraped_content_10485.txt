Title: What we can control Content: In every situation, there are things we can control and things we can’t. We can control what we say or do, but trying to control what we can't is a recipe for anxiety and stress.
Title: Knowing what we can control Content: If we could manage never to fret about things we can’t control, then life would proceed calmly. However, the truth of this statement can't bring peace of mind by itself.One of the many things we can't control is our emotions. If a global pandemic triggers anxiety about death or job security, anxieties formed over decades, it is almost impossible to think yourself into realizing they're insignificant.
Title: The dichotomy of control Content: A preliminary tool is to separate what you can control from what you can't. But you will only have peace of mind if you begin taking action in the realm of what you can control.We often have far more control than we realize. You can't stop a worldwide spread of a disease, but you can do a lot to prevent it from spreading to you: you can choose to eat well and to move. You can't choose to get through today's to-do list, but you can choose to spend the next three hours diligently attacking it.
