Title: Yoga And Sleep Content: Yoga research shows that after two months of regular 30 minutes practice it significantly reduces known causes of poor sleep stress, like anxiety and arousal. Research also shows that the more you practice yoga, the fewer sleep disturbances you are likely to experience and the better your sleep quality.
Title: Research On Yoga  Content: Regular yoga practice seems to correlate with increased wellbeing, including better sleep, better body awareness, weight loss, and greater happiness. It improves mindfulness and boosts compassion, gratitude, and "flow" states, all of which increase happiness. Early evidence suggests that yoga may even slow aging on the cellular level, perhaps through its stress-busting effects.
