Personal Development,Communication
Title: Be A Good Listener Content: You can’t remember everything, but at least remember people’s names. Repeating their names during the conversation is a good memory reinforcement. Also, listen with interest, pay attention, engage and be empathetic.Don’t: check your cell phone or look around the room to see if someone more important is there during a conversation.
Title: Tell Great Stories Content: Keep yourself informed and speak with conviction. Use words like “I am sure” vs. tentative words like “I think, I hope and I feel.” Use humor, even if it is self-deprecating.Don’t: Confuse humor with bad joke telling. And don’t overdo on the self-deprecation to the point you push yourself out of the conversation that it takes away from who you are.
Title: Use Body Language Content: Be open, approachable, gracious and graceful. Walk up to someone, smile, make eye contact, shake hands. Introduce yourself by saying your name.Don’t: Overdo it. When you smile, be authentic. If your smile is not in your eyes, people will know you're faking it.
Title: Make The Conversation About The Other Person Content: Let the conversation revolve around the person you’re talking to. This makes people feel like they matter and makes them more comfortable with you.Don’t: Let your ego drive the conversation.
Title: Be Confident Content: Like yourself. It’s much easier for others to like you if you like yourself. Be optimistic, enthusiastic, comfortable with who you are and consistent.Don’t: Trot out all your issues or you risk pushing people away. We all have problems, but compartmentalize them, park them in a corner and bring them out for close friends and family.
