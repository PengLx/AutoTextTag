Title: Skimmed Read Content: Reading is a complex process that involves the brain's visual and auditory processes, phonemic awareness, fluency and comprehension.There are billions of pages available to read online, along with billions of print books sold every year. All this choice is making us want to skim our reading, as we are short of time.There are trade-offs in this 'speedy' approach, as we are sacrificing the quality of understanding over the quantity of information.
Title: Slow Is Good Content: The speed-reading habit is making us lose our deep attention and focus, gradually shunning denser, more complicated content. Instead of optimizing for speed, we need to optimize for comprehension, deep understanding, and retention of information.Deep or slow reading, when the brain is attentive, absorbing, understanding and analyzing text expands our attention span and improves concentration and learning.
Title: Better, Not Faster Reading Content: The brain develops stronger analytical skills and gets into critical thinking mode, forming new connections and even creates new ideas.Deep focusing on a book is one of the best investments of your time.
