Title: Productive solitude Content: Solitude doesn't have to be a negative experience.Productive solitudehappens when we deliberately seek alone time. And this time should not be used for overthinking negative experiences, but for positive reflection and contemplation or for doing something we enjoy.
Title: Feeling active Content: In determining our pathway to wellbeing, it doesn’t just matter how physically active we are but how active (how energetic, vigorous, and vital) we feel.
Title: Future-mindedness Content: Even though our predictions aren’t always accurate,the simple act of contemplating the future might be a key to well-being.It usually is a 2-steps process: first, we dream big and imagine fantasy outcomes; then, we “get real” and come up with pragmatic plans.
