Title: When music helps productivity Content: A noisy workplace makes your brain consume extra energy to process the noise. This reduces productivity for tasks in general. Thus listening to music can help, as it blocks out other inputs.Listening to music you like while doing repetitive, and even complex, tasks may increase performance and accuracy. The music you enjoy makes your brain release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine, which help you feel relaxed and happy and, therefore, focus and cooperate better.
Title: When music doesn't help with productivity Content: Learning  requires your brain to analyze and remember information. Listening to music while learning adds an extra load of processing and this can lead the brain to misinterpret or miss important information.When you listen to music that's new to you, the activity involves an element of surprise or novelty. Your body releases dopamine in response to this, causing you to feel some degree of pleasure, and that may divert your attention.
