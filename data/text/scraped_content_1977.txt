Title: To change reality, stop denying it Content: Solving problems has to start with getting an accurate picture of reality and then deciding what to do about it.Forming opinions before trying to get all of the facts straight leads to bad decisions, poor choices, and further frustration down the line. In many cases, it exacerbates the problem.
Title: Dealing with the truth Content: When you have a choice between telling the truth or protecting someone’s feelings, it’s better to go with the truth,in a respectful way.Default to blaming yourself and what you control rather than looking for outside excuses.Check the sources of your beliefs. Ask yourself how you know what you’re saying. Did you research it? Or are you repeating a belief of the box you’re in?Choose truth over comfort. If an idea or some research offends you, that doesn’t mean it’s wrong.
