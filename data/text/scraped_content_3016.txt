Title: Good and bad meetings Content: Done right, meetings provide an excellent structure for getting work done, making decisions, and moving projects forward.Done incorrectly, meetings keep you from focusing on your most important priorities and are a complete waste of your time.
Title: Eliminate Content: Don’t schedule meetings: The answer to every issue or to moving ahead every project isn’t scheduling a meeting.Don’t attend meetings: You don’t have to accept every meeting invite you receive. Go to and be fully present at meetings where you have something to contribute or learn.Don’t agree to meetings requests from people you don't know: If you think a meeting is necessary, schedule it yourself.
Title: Reduce Content: Reduce frequency: Not all meetings need to be weekly. Reduce them to however often you need to stay on track.Reduce length: Your default could be 30 minutes or 45 minutes.Reduce drive-by meetings: Informal meetings can be valuable. But they can also be overwhelming when they take up the very limited amount of time you have between scheduled meetings.
Title: Streamline Content: Have an agenda: Make sure that no meeting wanders aimlessly without clarity about why you’re meeting and what you’re hoping to accomplish.Have a facilitator: He can explain the agenda, keep the conversation flowing in the right direction and make sure that everyone has clarity on the next steps by the end of the meeting.Have an out: This could mean scheduling back-to-back meetings or scheduling something at a time where you or the other person attending has to leave for something specific like catching a train.
