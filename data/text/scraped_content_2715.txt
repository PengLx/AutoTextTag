Love & Relationships,Communication
Title: Make small talk Content: You communicate a genuine interest when you inquire or listen to the small details that make up your partner’s day. It’s those insignificant moments that make up the reality of our lives.
Title: Shared experiences Content: We feel closer to others when we can talk about the experiences we have in common.Words are not necessary for shared feelings to improve a relationship. Just doing something at the same time—riding bikes, watching a movie, or eating dessert, intensifies both pleasant and unpleasant experiences.
Title: Listen carefully Content: Knowing that you are being heard is one of the experiences most likely to cement a feeling of connection to another.Use a technique called “active listening” - a form of listening in which you acknowledge that you understand what is being said.
Title: Ask questions Content: Don’t assume that you know the answers.
Title: Talk and listen  Content: Finding a healthy balance between talking and listening is difficult in most relationships, but even harder as you get to know each other, so it’s important that you both get a chance to talk and listen.
Title: Increase your "insignificant" experiences Content: Simply spending time together doing unimportant and supposedly meaningless activities—reading the paper, listening to music, watching TV, or doing laundry—can be more important to the health of a relationship than talking about feelings.
