Title: The origins of the breakfast myth Content: Much of the research suggesting that breakfast is essential for health is funded by cereal makers.Companies likeKellogg,Quaker Oats and others whose businesses depend on people believing that breakfast = easy to eat cereal, sponsored studies that demonstrate the benefits of eating breakfast on health and weight loss.
Title: Breakfast and weight loss/gain Content: There’s no clear evidence that breakfast consumption promotes weight loss or that skipping breakfast leads to weight gain.It might actually be a bad strategy for weight loss because eating breakfasts means taking in a higher number of calories/day.
Title: The health halo of breakfast Content: ...is not backed up by research.It is possible for breakfast to have health benefits, especially for some groups (growing children and athletes), but there’s not a lot of good evidence behind those benefits.
Title: Recommended breakfast foods Content: If you’re going to eat breakfast, seek out foods that give you the vitamins and nutrients you need to stay healthy, like fruits, vegetables, fiber-rich cereals, and eggs. Avoid desserts masquerading as breakfast, like high-sugar granola or yogurt.
