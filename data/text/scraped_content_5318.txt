People with strong social ties in a singular place live longer, healthier and happier lives.
Title: Nomads Content: We assume living alone provides us with freedom and independence, but the ground reality is quite different.  Nomads, while staying and working alone, meet new people, but don’t make any real friends.Many nomads have false assumptions about an office activity or event, and not being able to see your coworkers in person every day, leads to being ‘out of touch’.Constant working in isolation leads to irregular sleep patterns, mood swings and eating disorders due to a lack of routine and structure in a day.
Title: A Healthy Balance Content: Remote working may have tremendous advantages but research suggests that human beings aren’t meant to work in isolation. Working socially with co-workers who are good friends leads to higher engagement and satisfaction in one’s job.For remote working to be successful, it needs to be tailored to suit one’s particular needs and personality, finding a good fit, while taking care of one’s mental well-being.
