Problem Solving,Personal Development,Creativity,Reading & Writing
Title: Creativity and problem solving Content: Creativity is about problem-solving. And creativity is also aboutfinding problems to solve in the first place:perceiving them, defining them, explaining them, and recording them.
Title: Diving and swimming Content: This technique requires 2 steps:Deep immersion into a subject matterwithout specifically looking for an answer to your problem.Letting go completely while you process that information (actually walking away from it),to allow good ideas to bubble up from the subconscious and into clear view.
Title: Exaptation Content: This is theability to reach beyond a specific field of expertise and create new uses for an older thing.Itâ€™s about taking one thing and using it for a different purpose than intended.For example:Apply a cooking recipe to a marketing strategy or use a spreadsheet program to organize words for your poetry.
Title: Fill the well Content: This well is the place you take all your ideas (no matter how abstract they are) and get them stored as actual information, so they can be used.Get your ideas into a recorded state. Doing this over time means your idea well becomes both parts of your brain and a physical extension of it. Use a notepad, Pinterest or any place you find suitable.
