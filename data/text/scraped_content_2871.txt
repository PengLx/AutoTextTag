Title: Do Your Research First Content: Commit to a niche--but choose the one you can actually win.All the big names in your industry started out by dominating a small space. What do you want to be known for? What sets you apart from other established influencers in the same space?
Title: Weave Your Brand Into Everything You Do Content: For example, brand the content you're creating, whether it's great data (charts, research, infographics, visualizations, etc.), photos, memes, or cool diagrams or workflows.Think about the tone and style of your content. You need to be intentional in how you develop your personal brand. Simply blogging or showing up on social media doesn't cut it.
Title: Go Big at Industry Conferences or Stay Home Content: Generally, the people who attend a large industry conference will only remember the top 2 % - 5 % of sessions. The rest will be forgotten.You need to be great.If you aren't reasonably confident that you will be among the top presentations, don't bother.
Title: Invest in Yourself Content: That means you're going to have to pay for stuff.Consider: Hiring an editor to proofread your content. Hiring a speaking coach. Buying a book that will help you learn a new skill. Hiring graphic design help.
Title: Do something remarkable first Content: Many uber-wealthy and successful people have built unique personal brands. But they also did, created,or said remarkable things.Most people are better off spending time doing something remarkable before building a personal brand. So don't build a personal brand if it isn't time. Do something remarkable first!
