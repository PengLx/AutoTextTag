Title: Idea 1 Content: In the world of High-Frequency Trading, automated applications process hundreds of millions of market signals every day and send back thousands of orders on various exchanges around the globe.
Title: Idea 2 Content: In a typical architecture, financial exchange signals will be converted into a single internal market data format (exchanges use various protocols such as TCP/IP, UDP Multicast and multiple formats such as binary, SBE, JSON, FIX, etc.).Those normali     sed messages are then sent to algorithmic servers, statistics engines, user interfaces, logs servers, and databases of all kind (in-memory, physical, distributed).
Title: Idea 3 Content: Any latency along that path can have expensive consequences such as a strategy making decisions based on an old price or an order reaching the market too late.To gain those few crucial microseconds, most players invest in expensive hardware: pools of servers with overclocked liquid-cooled CPUs (in 2020 you can buy a server with 56 cores at 5.6 GHz and 1 TB RAM), collocation in major exchange datacentres, high-end nanosecond network switches, dedicated sub-oceanic lines (Hibernian Express is a major provider), even microwave networks.
Title:  Content: In the world of High-Frequency Trading, automated applications process hundreds of millions of market signals every day and send back thousands of orders on various exchanges around the globe.In order to remain competitive, the reaction time must consistently remain in microseconds, especially during unusual peaks such as a “black swan” event.
