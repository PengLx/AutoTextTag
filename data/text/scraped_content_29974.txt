Title: Emotional Intelligence: The Assumptions Content: Emotional Intelligence(EQ),  or the ability to be able to identify and respond to the other person’s feelings is a soft-skill based on two flawed assumptions:It is possible to detect or gauge the emotions of the other person accurately.Emotions are triggered by outside events and can be controlled by rationality.New studies find that faces and bodies are not the perfect communicators of a person’s emotional state, and one cannot control someone’s emotion using logic, making the traditional understanding of Emotional Intelligence outdated.
Title: The Neuroscientific View Of Emotional Intelligence Content: A scientific way to define and understand emotional intelligence is to view your brain as a construction, an on-the-fly builder of thoughts, emotions, and perceptions. The reflex-like emotional reactions are just the tip of the iceberg, and the brain is constantly shape-shifting itself and processing the sensory inputs that are received into useful predictions and actions.
Title: Emotional Granularity: Becoming An Emotional Expert Content: If the brain has a large, flexible range of diverse emotions in any given situation, it’s emotional intelligence is wide-ranging and finely tailored. This ability of a flexible, emotion-rich brain is called granularity.Real emotional intelligence means understanding that sometimes feelings and emotions cannot be distilled and expressed using a predefined slot. Emotional granularity is the coming-of-age of the decades old understanding of EQ, now evolved and unfolding its many facets.
