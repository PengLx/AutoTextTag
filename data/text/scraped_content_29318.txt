Title: Squattin’ Content: By Dale Clark  Way down this road, in a gym far awayA young man was once heard to say,“I’ve repped high and I’ve repped low,No matter what I do, my legs won’t grow.”He tried leg extensions, leg curls and leg presses, tooTrying to cheat, these sissy workouts he’d doFrom the corner of the gym where the big men train,Through a cloud of chalk in the midst of pain.Where the big iron rides high and threatens lives,Where the noise is made with big forty-fives,A deep voice bellowed as he wrapped up his knees,A very big man with legs like trees,Laughing as he snatched another plate from the stack,Chalking his hands and his monstrous back,Said, “Boy, stop lying and don’t say you’ve forgottenTrouble with you is you ain’t been squattin’.”©Dale Clark 1983.“Squattin’” was published in MILO: A Journal for Serious Strength Athletes in September 1997, Vol. 5, No. 2 .
