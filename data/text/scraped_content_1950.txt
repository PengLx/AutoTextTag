Title: Mood And Posture Content: The more time a person spends in a bad posture, the more the body’s muscles and ligaments embrace it as normal.Human emotion and cognition are closely linked to body posture. And this link operates like a two-way street. Feeling depressed or frightened can cause a person’s head to drop or his posture to become tight and closed, but assuming these poses also seems to promote feelings of depression or fear.
Title: Consequences Of Bad Posture Content: Slouching promotes low mood, decreased energy levels and can even impair student performance on a math test.Upright posture is linked with improved mood and energy levels among people with symptoms of depression. The bent-over posture associated with smartphone use could hamper breathing and impair respiratory function.
Title: Combating Bad Posture Content: Switch up your desk setup in ways that promote proper posture.Pulling exercises will strengthen them your back muscles, but upright or bent-over rows are ideal.Planks, push-ups, dead lifts and other exercises that make you hold your body in a rigid position help develop posture as they activate your core and stabilizer muscles.Glute bridgeshelp to increase strength and flexibility of hips and that promotes stable movement and posture.Limit “flexion” exercises that involve curling your spine into a C-shape.If you spend the bulk of your week sitting with poor posture a few hours of exercise won’t fix it.
