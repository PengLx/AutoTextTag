Title: Apply Conviction To What You Are Doing Content: Believe in yourself and apply maximum conviction and dedication to what you are doing. Don't "try", do it. This puts you ahead of the competition.This applies to your physical body as well. If you are constantly slouched with a frown on your face and arms crossed, that may not serve you well. That kind of posture can come across as defensive, negative or closed minded. A strong, positive, and open posture will make things that much more attainable.
Title: Reframe Your Problems Content: Problems can be interpreted as opportunities to use different resources and find alternatives.A problem means life is eliminating options and helping you choose how you are going to be successful. In the case of not having money, it may mean you have to learn to do it yourself.
