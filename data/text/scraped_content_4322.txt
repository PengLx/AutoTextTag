Title: Productivity guilt Content: Productivity guilt happens when you feel overwhelmed by not attending to all the things you know you "should" be doing and having a nagging feeling that you're wasting time.
Title: Hidden contradictions of life advice Content: In practice, adding too many suggestions for living well will create a conflict with each other.Suggestions are almost always given on their own, without including a wider context. You can read about why exercise, reading or meditating are good on their own, but rarely find information about how they trade-off against each other.
Title: Being too tired Content: There are two different types of feeling tired.The feeling you have as you're about to start an activity. Once you actually do it, your mood changes and you find you're glad you did it.The second kind persists throughout the activity itself. You find you struggle with pushing through more than five minutes of it. If you feel like this for weeks at a time, your habits are probably unsustainable.
Title: Doing 'everything' Content: You cannot do everything you should. It is okay to acknowledge that time for one activity means less time for another. In theory, there's enough time for everything - in practice, there are always trade-offs.
Title: More hassle than help Content: Distinguish between a lack of inertia and persistent exhaustion.If you push yourself to the gym but feel good afterward, it's good. But if you always feel exhausted in everything, you need to modify your priorities.
