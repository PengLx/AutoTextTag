Title: Realistic expectations Content: Anxiety is often caused by our own expectations. For example, we may expect a road to be smooth, but driving into a pothole may cause great anxiety. The anxiety is caused by the expectation of a good road when it doesn't fit the facts.To overcome unrealistic expectations, we can adjust old expectations for new information.
Title: Cortisol is the root of anxiety Content: We prefer to hold on to old experiences. It helps us make sense of the world: It protects us from touching a fire or eating poison berries. But when the expectations cause anxiety, we can adjust them.If you get what you expect, your brain releases a bit of dopamine and moves on. If it conflicts, cortisol is released, which motivates us to pay more attention, but it also fuels anxiety.
Title: Emotion and repetition Content: To make sense of the world, our brain makes neural pathways from its past experience. These pathways allow us to become efficient and not doubt every move we make. However, when we need to update our expectations to a new reality, our brain has to create new pathways. One tool is to use emotion, but it's limiting. The other is repetition. If you repeat a new behavior for 45 days, you will build a new expectation.To rewire yourself to focus on the good you want instead of disappointed expectations, use both emotion and repetition.
