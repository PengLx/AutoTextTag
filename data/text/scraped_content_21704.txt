Title: Believing in luck Content: Luck is a hard thing to prove. There is no real thing we can call luck, but we can create a real object and transfer luck to it, such as a lucky penny or a lucky charm.These lucky objects give the feeling of a security blanket. They provide an illusion of control for the person who believes in them.
Title: Studies on lucky charms Content: Studies reveal that people perform better on tasks when they have a lucky charm with them. During a series of memory tasks, students who were allowed to keep their lucky charms performed better than students who had their charms taken away.Attitude plays a big role in luck. Someone who believes they are lucky will try harder at a challenging task. That persistence can have a self-reinforcing effect. The harder the task they take on, the more chance of success, increasing the belief that they are lucky.
Title: A positive attitude and luck Content: A positive attitude towards life makes it seem like more happy events happen for a person. While it is not rational to believe in luck, understanding the psychology behind it can explain why some people seem to be successful while others can never get to the top.
