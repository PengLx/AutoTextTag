Title: Nostalgia is overrated Content: If you start every conversation with, “Hey, remember that time when… ?” you and your friend will die of boredom.You need new things, new memories, rather than using nostalgia as the glue holding a friendship together. Living in the past can make you both feel emotionally stunted and a bit stale.
Title: It’s good to have “your thing” Content: People get busy and life has dramatic ups and downs, but if you watch Drag Race every Friday together or bake Betty Crocker cookies every month, you have something to anchor you through the chaos of life.
Title: “Best friend” is a tier, not a person Content: Friendship is not a monogamous relationship; there is room for more than one. When you’ve known someone for years, try to be confident in the bond you’ve got.
Title: Fight like siblings Content: Unless something truly terrible happens, there’s no room for grudges. You will annoy each other, of course, but it’s always better to get over it quickly.
Title: Commitment Content: It is key to maintaining real relationships.Turn up, because you know they would do the same for you in a heartbeat.
