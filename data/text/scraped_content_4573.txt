Title: The Lost Art Of Reading Content: In the digital age, where reading material is abundant, sustained and deep reading is falling out of favor. Readers have lost the 'cognitive patience' that they had reading complex works in the pre-internet age.Deep reading, that was once natural, is now a struggle, thanks to the explosion of shallow material and reduced attention spans.
Title: Reading In The Digital Age Content: New readers, especially children have reduced deep-reading skills.Digital media is consumed differently in a 'skimming' time-bound way, as opposed to the profound, thoughtful reading associated with print books.People have become addicted to digital devices, as the content they see and read may not be deep and immersive, but is engaging and conversation like, rendering it more alive than the printed word.
Title: Rewiring The Brain Content: The Internet is training our brain to adapt and work differently than in the last century, as the changing technological landscape requires different cognitive skills.The new digital mediums mostly do not have the quality, as most of the stuff online seems uninteresting, but it has the quantity, making it even more discordant and chaotic.
Title: Junk Reading Vs Healthy Reading Content: The brain has been conditioned to feed on bite-sized snacks of shallow literature, and a reconditioning of the brain is essential.The old-school print books were a way to slow down the mind, turning it less anxious and jittery, resulting in a satisfying trance-like experience, almost like a low-level meditation.We need to stop feeding our minds with disposable, junk knowledge and focus on developing it by reading healthy literature.
