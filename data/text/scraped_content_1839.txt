Title: Life lessons Content: Sex matters. In all aspects of our lives, it's good to ask, "what does sex have to do with it?"Sex can be as addicting as cocaine."When our desire for 'more sex' interferes with our family or professional lives, we are looking for love in all the wrong places."Many of us settle for sex when we're really looking for love.There is a strong drive to be part of a male tribe.The same forces that bring us together within a tribe often pit us against other tribes."For humans there is always a selfishness at the group level. Humans nearly always put Us ahead of Them."The way we treat "them" is the way we ultimately treat ourselves.Truly, what goes around, comes around.
