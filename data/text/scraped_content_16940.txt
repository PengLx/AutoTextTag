Title: Consistency over intensity Content: Some business coaches advise their clients to focus on taking massive action in order to get results.While intensity may help occasionally, it's usually better to focus on consistency.
Title: Focus on consistency Content: If you have a goal of writing a book, and you focus on intensity, you may lock yourself away for thirty days, and write eight hours a day. It will require a huge block of dedicated time and lots of motivation.Instead of writing a 50,000-word book in thirty days, write 500 words a day for 100 days.Instead of going on a two-week fast to get in better shape, eliminate sugar and processed carbs from your diet.Instead of waiting to start your business until you've quit your job, set aside three hours a week and start a side gig.The intensity approach is more dramatic but slow and steady wins the race.
Title: Steps you can use to employ consistency Content: Get clear on your goal.Identify the right behavior. (i.e., a habit).Track your progress. Create a recurring task in your task manager to reinforce the habit.Enlist an accountability partner. It could be someone who wants to achieve the same goal, a coach, or just a friend who is willing to support you.
