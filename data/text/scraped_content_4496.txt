Title: Being in Control Content: To be in control does not mean restraining. A person who is in control should have the capacity and freedom to self-govern.Rather than fighting with your body, provide it with an autonomous control by allowing all kinds of foods back in your life, yet eating consciously, paying attention to your meals, savoring them fully.Being mindful can maximize your pleasure and minimize your eating.
Title: A Holistic Approach Content: Accepting that it is ok to make mistakes makes us patient and kind towards ourselves, and keeps us on track with our diet goals, as we understand that our urges to overeat are part of the process.Instead of obsessing over the 'diet' mentality, it is better to focus on your behavioral changes and new habits, incorporating certain activities in your routine. The focus should be on a healthy and holistic lifestyle.
Title: Eating to Relieve Emotional Discomfort Content: Eating can be an emotional activity, with deep connections on how our brains and bodies work. Emotional overeaters are:Having a feeling of resentment after neglecting one's own needs to appease others.Feeling undeserving of their success, with a fear of being shamed.Being a perfectionist and being constantly anxious about the possible mistakes.Suppressing of all negative emotions.Overeaters tend to have an 'all-or-nothing' approach oscillating between an all-good diet or an outright unhealthy one, depending on the particular underlying emotion.
Title: Eating Disorders Content: Eating disorders, from binge eating to calorie counting, or feeling guilty of eating 'bad' foods can wreak havoc on our health and happiness.The core issue lies within our emotions, and how our mind works against the goal of weight loss.Diet restrictions only work with willpower which can fade, as it usually does.
