Title: Get a good night’s rest Content: The first key to productivity: getting enough sleep.7-8 hours of sleep a night will improve into your work, from sharper decision making and problem-solving, to better coping with change.It is not just the quantity of sleep that matters, but quality as well. You should try to stick to a regular sleep pattern.
Title: Drink some coffee at work Content: Caffeine has a range of positive impacts beyond keeping you awake: from increased alertness and reaction time to improved learning, memory, and even mood.Andcoffee isn’t just effective on a chemical level:scheduling coffee breaks so that the entire team took it at the same time increased productivity. 
Title: Take regular break Content: Taking breaks during the workday is important for workers to replace workplace “resources” - energy, motivation, and concentration.These resources are limited and they need “charging” by doing activities that require less effort or use different resources than normal work or are just something the worker enjoys.
Title: Tackle procrastination Content: Divide tasks into smaller pieces so you can work through a more manageable series of assignments.Use the higher energy levels you have in the morning to do a small task you don’t feel like doing, such as phoning someone you have been reluctant to contact. You’ll give yourself the mood and energy boost that comes from a small achievement.
Title: Do one thing at a time Content: Don’t be tempted to multitask. Our brains are not suited to dealing with multiple streams of information or doing multiple jobs at the same time.The more tasks we try to do simultaneously, the slower we complete them and the more mistakes we make.
