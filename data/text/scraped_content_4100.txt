Title: Workaholism Content: Far too many people spend 80% of their waking hours slogging away at a desk and view any break from this routine as a naughty deviation from duties.Workism, where people worship their work, leave hordes of purportedly "Type A" people without hobbies, companionship, or a sense of self outside the daily grind.
Title: Workaholism: factors Content: Many people cannot choose a reasonable work schedule:They're underpaid and dependent on overtime wages for the survival of their families.Many high-status workers who can afford a break, opt instead to toil continually.This widespread workaholism, in part, reflects the misguided notion that having fun is somehow an over-indulgence.
Title: Working less to produce more Content: Many people across the world take six weeks of vacation a year and still manage to produce functioning companies and political systems.Working more than 55 hours a week produces diminishing returns of productivity.
Title: Work and leisure Content: Work is fun, and a life without meaningful labor can make one miserable.However, work should not be the only enjoyable activity in life. Working hard is only a part of the good life. Financial rewards that come from hard labor should be put to use for the sake of leisure.
