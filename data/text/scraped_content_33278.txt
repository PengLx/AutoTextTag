Title: Not Knowing Is Hard Content: Uncertainty and the eventual anxiety that gets evoked due to the ongoing health crisis and the risk factors towards us and our loved ones is a familiar and frequent occurrence to many. Not surprisingly, the U.S. has reported a dramatic increase in cases of anxiety in 2020.We all are in the dark in the present moment, uncertain about the availability of the vaccine, reopening of schools, the political landscape, and how our job will be affected.
Title: Ways We Can Cope With Pandemic Anxiety Content: Choose positivity, believing in yourself and your ability to handle whatever will happen.Remember that being in the dark does not automatically mean a bad outcome, and (just like in the horror movies) the unknown that causes the most chills, even if nothing happens.Practice imagination and visualize a good future, which gives your brain a better grip on the mountain it is climbing.Think out of the box and develop skills that help you cope up with things, getting into the learning and eventually the growth zone.
