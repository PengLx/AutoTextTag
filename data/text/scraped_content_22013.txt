Title: It takes practice to get good at anything Content: Feedback is essential when you learn a new skill. However, when people learn the skill of 'creating new habits,' they think making mistakes is a sign of being a failure and showing an utter lack of discipline.In reality, this is not true. No one mastered anything on their first few attempts â€” it takes practice to get good at anything.
Title: Committing to actually starting Content: Overcome your mind's resistance to get started by saying, "I'm all in. I'm going to start today." Then get moving. If you're not good at this, commit to making a small habit change this instant.Many people want to learn a language or start exercising, but then don't take action. It is because they haven't really committed to getting started.
Title: Focus on starting Content: The skill to master is getting started. You don't have to exercise for half an hour; you only need to start.Often, we're supposed to do a new habit, and we procrastinate, turn to distractions, and rationalize our resistance. 
Title: Noticing rationalizations Content: Our minds are good at coming up with rationalizations, especially when we're procrastinating on something:It's too hard.You don't need to suffer like this.You deserve a break.You'll do it tomorrow.The skill to master is to recognise this rationalization process in action. Be mindful of it. Once you become aware of it, come up with counterarguments for each rationalization.
Title: Constant re-adjustment Content: People fail to realise how important developing the habit skill is. They have a specific idea of what their habit will be like, and when it doesn't go according to plan, they feel guilty and think they're a failure.Overcome this with a flexible mindset.  If you forget to do the habit, adjust by coming up with reminders. If you procrastinate on social media block it until 5 p.m.
