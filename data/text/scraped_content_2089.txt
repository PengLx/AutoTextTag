Title: Listen Content: The more you expose yourself to the new language, the sooner you will become familiar with its sounds and structures. Familiarity, in turn, will speed understanding.
Title: Copy Content: Repeating the sounds (out loud or in your head) will give you a feel for the language. Memorize not just words, but sentences and even songs to get the rhythm and intonation of the language. 
Title: Read Content: Read words, sentences, childrenâ€™s books, newspaper articles. Read as far and near as you can, whether out loud to an audience or quietly to yourself. Seeing the language in print helps you understand word structures. It also anchors the new sounds, and helps them get imprinted in your mind.
Title: Talk Content: Create the need to talk in your new language. Regularly, seek opportunities for conversations, brief and long, with old neighbors and new friends. Start with short sentences. Be prepared to make mistakes. Welcome when someone corrects you.
