Title: Tips For Asking For Help Content: Don't frame your request.Don't imply that you're above the other person. Don't make your request too specific. Say what you can't do, so the other can tell you what they think is the best course.Show respect by acknowledging the capabilities of others.
Title: How To Ask For Help Content: When we ask for help, we tend to unconsciously add unnecessary details that enhance our image, justify or even state a request instead. When asking for help, take the bass out of your voice, the stiffness out of your spine, and the captain out of your industry and just say, with sincerity and humility: "Can you help me?"Few people, especially face-to-face, will ever say "no," even a stranger.
