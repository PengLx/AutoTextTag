Title: Asynchronous Communication Content: .. .is defined as working with tools that don’t demand an immediate response. Remote work has its own set of challenges (like different time zones) and is filled with distractions. In order to keep productivity up within a working team while providing them the flexibility they need to take care of their families (and themselves), there is a need to increase the use of asynchronous communication.
Title: Well Thought Out Actions Content: Asynchronous communication allows you to think and reflect before taking action.While real-time communication is all-important, the global crisis and work-from-home culture have made us realize the productivity benefits of non-real time communication.
Title: Asynchronous Video  Content: Constant video interaction is great to look as if you are working but isn’t the best use of your time. Rather than being on the video call for everything, it’s better to make a video recording of the particular action (in your own time) and let others see it when they can.Use asynchronous video to be able to show your face and expressions when needed, getting in touch the real way in a remote setting. This leaves time for your 'deep work' activities.
Title: Voice Notes Content: They are a great way to call someone and talk to them without disturbing them in real-time.A phone call is no longer polite now and sending a voice message while discussing an idea, feedback, or reflection is a ‘soft’ method that works asynchronously.
Title: Email in Asynchronous Communication Content: This is one of the oldest and most reliable means of asynchronous communication.Using email in conjunction with a text message or an attached video works even better. Try to be contextual and respect the other person's time.
