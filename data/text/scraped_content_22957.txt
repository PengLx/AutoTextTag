Title: Calendar Management Mistakes Content: Mixing tasks in the same time frame or attempting multitasking may provide an illusion that more work is being done in less time, but is ineffective and takes longer to finish tasks.Calling one-on-one meetings and team meetings randomly or as per convenience will not do any good for the productivity of the employees, as they will be tied up attending the meetings and making the notes.
Title: Staggered Calendar Content: For a manager handling a set of team members, staggering of specific To-Dos and stacking them together makes it a focused task, and is done with efficiency.Example: All one-on-one meetings can be stacked in a single day, while team meetings can be done on another day.
Title: Benefits Of Staggering Content: The main objective is to save time and leave open days for deep work, where there are no meetings to attend and the tasks at hand can be focused on without official distractions.As information moves slowly, one-on-one meetings help identify problems that can be resolved the next day during a team meeting. Senior management can take it up later in the week if required.
