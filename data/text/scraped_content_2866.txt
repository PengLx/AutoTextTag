Title: Cognitive Reframing Content: It's amethod of looking at things in ways that create less stress and promote a greater sense of peace and control.It means changing the way you look at something and thus changing your experience of it.
Title: Learn About Thinking Patterns Content: Educateyourself about thinking patterns that may exacerbate your stress levels (for example, being aware of common cognitive distortions).This process is important for laying the groundwork for understanding and change.
Title: Notice Your Thoughts Content: Become more mindful of your thoughts, as though you're an observer.Once you become more of an observer, it's easier to notice your thoughts rather than remaining caught up in them.
Title: Challenge Your Thoughts Content: An effective part of reframing involves examining the truth and accuracy (or lack thereof) of your negative thoughts.Instead of seeing things the way you always have, challenge every negative thought, and see if you can adopt thoughts that fit your situation but reflect a more positive outlook.
Title: Replace Your Negative Thoughts  Content: Look for the 'gift' in each situation, and see if you can see your stressors on the more positive edge of reality.When you're looking at something negative, see if you can change your self talk to use less strong, less negative emotions. When you're looking at a potentially stressful situation, see if you can view it as a challenge versus a threat.
