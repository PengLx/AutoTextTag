Title: The wrong questions Content: Some questions are too easy to fake, for example,"What's your greatest weakness?" Other questions like brainteasers reveal more about the manager than the candidate.Behavioral questions about a past experience can help anticipate future behavior. "Tell me about a time when..."Include some situational questions. "What would you do if..." Pick something that is important for success in the job and work culture.
Title: The wrong criteria Content: Some managers favor candidates who went to the same school. There's also evidence that African-American sounding names, birthmarks, being pregnant, and being overweight puts candidates at a disadvantage.To overcome this bias, identify the key skills and values in advance, then create a standard set of behavioral and situational questions to ask every candidate. Doing this can triple the manager's accuracy in predicting job performance.
Title: Favoring the best talkers Content: College seniors often stretch the truth in interviews to make a better impression. Be aware that when you meet someone for the first time, you meet their representative.An antidote could include to let them showcase their skills by collecting a work sample. It might be a project they've done in the past or a live simulation of the job in real-time.
Title: The best candidate Content: Credentials may be overrated, but motivation is often underrated. A candidate may have a lot of experience but may lack the drive to think creatively and work collaboratively. The right candidate will also be hungry and eager to improve.
