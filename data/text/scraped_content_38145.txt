Title: Attention management Content: Set your chat status to “do not disturb” when you need uninterrupted time to focus.Put your phone away or silence it while working.Close all unnecessary browser tabs and applications on your computer when you need to concentrate.Take breaks throughout the day where you’re not looking at a screen at all.Check the news, social media, personal email, etc. in between tasks—not in the middle of them.If a new item for your to-do list pops into your head during focused work, jot it down on a piece of paper (don’t change what’s on your screen!) and come back to it later.
