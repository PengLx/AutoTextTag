Title: Your thoughts don't define you; your actions do Content: Action gets results. Results are what you want, not just ideas.Don't spend all your time thinking about everything you can improve. Until you start doing what needs to be done, you're not really making a difference.
Title: Getting started is the most difficult Content: The biggest hurdle is to take that first step. You have everything you need to make an impact in the world if you can push the reasons aside why you should not start now.Use what you have right now where you are and just start. Watch the magic of getting things done.
Title: Do one thing well, not three things poorly Content: Many people want to do well at work. You may risk and do much but will have nothing to show for it.You won't be able to do everything this week or this month. That is okay. As long as you are consistent and stick to the process. It's important to take time out and ask how you could have done differently to achieve the same results.
Title: Focus on the important few, and ignore the rest Content: The demand for our time is increasingly more than our capacity. We are currently flooded with information and requests and may feel compelled to meet the expectations. It is draining us of the energy we need. But being selective and doing less is the path of the productive. 
Title: The perfect time is now Content: We will always be able to come up with another excuse why this is not the best time. There is no perfect time.  So re-clarify your goals.What do you want to achieve?What should you do to get there?What are the steps to take?
Title: Doing nothing Content: Sometimes you can feel like you're always working against the clock, and rearranging plans and tasks to meet deadlines. When you do take time to relax, you feel guilty.Taking breaks refreshes your mind and allows you to come back to your task with renewed energy and a sense of purpose.
