Title: Deal with Failure Content: You may fail a thousand times but in the end, what matters is your success, once you get the success you will get addicted to it and at that point, no one can make you suppress that feeling. Well, nothing is free everything has a price and you have to pay something in return of something, but when we talk about life itâ€™s not money, money cannot make immortal, even money asks for hard work and sweat to be earned, same goes for failure, most of the people fail in the blocked road only, the one who makes it earns the reward.
