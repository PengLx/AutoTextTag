Title: The Art Of Studying: Revision Content: During studies, how we revise what we have learned is a personal preference, which we incorporate after trial and error and what feels intuitive or effective to us.According to research, the popular revising methods like rereading, highlighting and summarizing don’t seem to work as effectively as previously thought.
Title: Revision: Popular But Low-Utility Techniques Content: Rereading: A widely followed method of passively studying again what is already studied, rereading has been proven to be ineffective and inefficient.Highlighting: Another popular method is proven by the study to be a mere ‘safety blanket’, and may hinder our learning by disconnecting certain aspects of information, due to us paying attention to only the highlighted stuff.Summarizing: Making notes seems to be an extremely reliable revision method, but is proven to be partially effective for people who are skilled in the art of summarizing information, and not for others.
Title: How To Revise: Active Recall Content: Active recall and self-questioning (Quiz Mode), which trains the brain to fetch information, are the best way to retain the study material and form connections.
