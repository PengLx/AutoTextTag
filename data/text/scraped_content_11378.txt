Title: Misophonia Content: Misophonia is a neurophysiological condition where people have an excessively negative reaction to specific sounds, like slurping, humming, tapping, typing, or texting.Misophonia means "hatred of sound" and people with this condition are aware of their overreaction, but can't control their reaction.
Title: The trigger sounds Content: The aversion to trigger sounds develops in childhood and tends to get worse over time.The sounds are commonly related to the mouth, nasal sound, and hand sounds, and are more distressing if family members produce them.
Title: Misophonic responses Content: Anger is the most common misophonic response, followed by anxiety or disgust.In misophonia, people react to sounds that are not widely considered unpleasant, such as whispering or soft breathing.
Title: Fight or flight Content: Misophonics are unable to ignore annoying sounds. It seems that selective attention may be impaired in these individuals. The only option when their attention becomes fixated on a trigger sound may be fight or flight.The condition and treatment are still in its infancy, although some evidence suggests that cognitive-behavioral therapy may help.
