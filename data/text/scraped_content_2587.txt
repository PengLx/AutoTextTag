Title: Guiding The Unconscious Mind Content: You can work with the unconscious to unearth its associations and align them more closely with your values and goals. Doing so, you can tap all the power the unconscious has to offer.Pause whenever you feel yourself about to react. Take a deep breath, step back and give yourself the opportunity to respond.
Title: The Unconscious Mind Content: Left to its own devices, the unconscious mind creates inaccurate beliefs and self-imposed limitations. Its main goal is your survival and it does what it can to get rid of threats, even if it means derailing your conscious goals.That said, the unconscious can also give the energy to accomplish your goals and offer a lot of intuitive wisdom. But to get to those benefits you need to help it transcend its useless limitations.
Title: Of Reaction And Response Content: A reaction is instant and driven by the beliefs of the unconscious mind. When you say or do something “without thinking,” that’s the unconscious mind making decisions in your stead.Responses, on the other hand, are slower and based on information from both the conscious and unconscious mind. A response takes into consideration the well-being of not only you but those around you, weighs the long term effects and your core values.
