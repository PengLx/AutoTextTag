Title: A Definition of Friendship Content: A friendship is a mutual relationship between two people that is satisfying, safe, and where both people feel seen.
Title: Positivity Content: In order for a relationship to be satisfying, it must have a foundation of positivity.Positive feelings are paramount to our friendships because these are the relationships we are entering by choice. We all want our friendships to add more joy, peace, and support to our lives.
Title: Consistency Content: In order for a relationship to be safe, it must develop consistency.Consistency is the action of repeating our time together which in turn develops our trust as we begin to create and modify expectations of each other. It’s what builds a shared history and increases our commitment and feeling of support in each other.
Title: Vulnerability Content: In order for a relationship where both people feel seen, it must develop vulnerability.As we spend more consistent time together, we are also incrementally revealing and sharing more of who we are with each other. The more we let someone see us (always increasing our positivity with responses such as affirmation, acceptance, and empathy) then the more loved we’ll feel for who we are.
