Title: Finding freedom Content: In anything you do today and for the next few days, try to remember to practice creating freedom. You might be washing a dish, answering an email, talking to someone, driving, anything.Notice in the moment the feeling of burden and closedness that you’ve created for yourself.See if you can create a feeling of freedom without changing what you’re doing externally.Enjoy this joyous feeling of freedom!And repeat, all day long.What is it like to live freedom without having to change anything? This doesn’t mean you never change anything externally, but it means you’re liberated from having to do so.
