Title: Step Away from the Spreadsheet Content: Shut off your brain and stop working. The tasks will still be there tomorrow—plus some more, because work can, and should, wait.
Title: Look Back, Look Ahead Content: Review what you accomplished today, then make a to-do list for tomorrow.Don’t make these lists too close to bedtime.
Title: Cool It Content: According to the National Sleep Foundation, the ideal temperature for shut-eye is around 65 degrees.The cooler you are, the sleepier you become, so turn down the thermostat.
Title: Cut Off the Alcohol (and Snacks) Content: At least two hours before bedtime, cut off the booze, food, and stimulants (not just coffee and soda, but also sugary desserts and even fruits).Digestion and sleep don’t mix well.
Title: Clean It Up Content: Waking up to a messy household isn’t the way to start the day.Tidy up the kitchen, your bedroom, your workspace, and everything else within eyesight before you hit the sack for a clearer path in the morning.
Title: Relax with a Book Content: Get in some light reading before bedtime.Good old-fashioned print is preferable to an iPad or Kindle. The light from the screen of your tablet or phone is blue-spectrum light … it tells the brain to stop secreting melatonin [a natural sleep-inducing biochemical].
Title: Dress for No Stress Content: Plan and lay out tomorrow’s clothing ensemble tonight, and you’ll have one less thing to worry about. If your first outfit of the day is gym clothes for a morning workout, even better.
