Title: Reason Is Subject To Passion Content: Humans, by nature, are rationally weak but passionately motivated. Emotions are always stronger and drive action, and reasoning is often used as an excuse for inaction.Neuroscience is now revisiting emotions as drivers of action, reducing them to mere tools. The complexity of emotions, especially the mixed variety, runs deeper than just being catalysts for action.
Title: Automatic Actions To Responses Content: Our emotions often trigger automatic actions which we tend to regret later. The suffering that we and others then undergo can be termed as compassion. The challenge is to distance ourselves from our automatic emotions that trigger reflex actions, or reactions.True, responsive action has to be cultivated by being aware of our actions, habits and emotions. By checking our habits, and ensuring that whatever we do has value in it, we can get rid of our reactions, based on emotions.
