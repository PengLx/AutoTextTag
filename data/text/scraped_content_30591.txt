Title: Ease of use is a barebones necessity Content: As a client or business stakeholder, ease of use is a barebones expectation of any product. Anything that is not intuitive to use might affect conversion rates, level of engagement, and any other metric that makes the product logically viable.
Title: Foundational Heuristics for Intuitive Design Content: The problem with the word “intuitive” is that it means different things for different people: a product that is intuitive to me, might not be intuitive to my father.But if you look deeper into what people really mean when they start outlining examples of experiences that “feel intuitive”, you end up with a pretty foundational set of design principles that should sound very familiar if you are a UX or UI designer:Visibility: are important elements visible on the screen? The more visible an element is, the more likely users will know about them and how to use them.Feedback: once the user takes action, is it clear to them what action has been taken and what has been accomplished by that action?Constraints: does the interface limit the set of actions that can be taken by the user? Endless possibilities often leave the user confused.Affordances: does the design help people understand how to interact with certain elements? Affordances are all about giving users “clues” of how each component works.Discoverability: is it possible to figure out how to use an object by interacting with it?Orientation: does the user know where they are within the product structure at any given point in time? Do they know how to move back, and to move forward?Expectation: does the outcome of an action align with the expectation users had about what the result would be, before taking that action?Efficiency: is the product efficient in helping users accomplish a task? Is there room for increased efficiency, shorter flows, or quicker results?
