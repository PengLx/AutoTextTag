Title: Preserving optionality Content: Preserving optionality means avoiding limiting choices or dependencies. It means staying open to opportunities and always having a backup plan.The more options we have, the better suited we are to deal with unpredictability and uncertainty.
Title: Having options Content: We are faced with options all the time, but life-altering ones often come up during times of great change. These options are the ones we have the hardest time capitalizing on.If we’ve specialized too much, change is a threat, not an opportunity. Thus, if we aren’t certain where the opportunities are going to be (and we never are), then we need to make choices to keep our options open.

Title: Strength vs. optionality Content: This is also known as the coach’s dilemma.Over-specializing in one area is highly limiting, especially if it requires extensive upkeep. Like a football player, we can retain optionality by avoiding overtly damaging risks and ensuring we stay in the game for as long as possible—whatever that game is. That might mean lifting less metaphorical weight at any one time, while also working to keep ourselves flexible.
