Title: Understand the requirements Content: To solve a problem, you have to understand exactly what the problem is. When you start solving a problem, be sure to understand the starting point, the end goal, and the obstacles in between. The worst possible thing is to produce a solution that actually doesn’t do what’s expected.
Title: Understand the size of the problem Content: It's important to understand what is how big the problem is.Use questions like:How many requests the system should satisfy?What is the expected response time?How many resources do we have?What about deadlines?
Title: Stand on the shoulders of giants Content: The chance someone else already solved your problem is high.All you have to do is a search in the literature to find out if there is a solution for a problem matching your use case.There is no point in reinventing the wheel.
Title: "Grandma-driven" development Content: Implement your solution trying to make it understandable by your grandma. Avoid fancy and complex implementations. Put them aside in favor of a simple and understandable one. And optimization to the moment they are necessary.
