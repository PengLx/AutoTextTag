Title: Wasting time and productivity guilt Content: Living in a culture of non-stop productivity, we refuse to take real breaks. We put off sleeping in or reading by the window. Even if we do manage to take time away, it comes with the feeling that we should be doing things. We feel guilty about any wasted time.But “wasted” time is highly fulfilling and necessary. Wasting time is about recharging your battery and de-cluttering.
Title: Taking breaks does not mean we're wasting time Content: When we refuse to take real breaks, we tend to turn to the least fulling tendency: We sit in front of our computer and start zoning out. We browse websites and tell ourselves we're "multitasking," but are really spending much longer on the most basic tasks.This neither contributes to happiness nor productivity.
Title: We don't need to work so hard Content: Luminaries such as Charles Dickens, Gabriel García Márquez, and Charles Darwin worked for five hours a day or less. In truth, work expands to fill the time allotted. Most of us could spend fewer hours at the office and do the same amount of work.Taking the time to be unproductive will make you better at your job.
