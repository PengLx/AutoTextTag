Title: Learning is necessary for our success and personal growth Content: But we can’t maximize the time we spend learning because our feelings about what we ‘should’ be doing get in the way.
Title: When our brains equate learning and work Content: If we are learning for work, then in our brains learning equals work. So we think we have to do it during the day, at our workplace.We think that walking is not learning. It’s ‘taking a break’. We instinctively believe that reading is learning. Having discussions about what you’ve read, however, is often not considered work, again it’s ‘taking a break’.
Title: The focused and diffuse thinking modes Content: When mastering a subject, our brain has two general modes of thinking: focused and diffuse, both important in the learning process. The focused mode is what we traditionally associate with learning. But we need time to process what we pick up, to get this new information integrated into our existing knowledge. We need time to make new connections. This is where the diffuse mode comes in.
