Title: Emotional Validation Content: Many people need approval from others when it comes to one’s shortcomings and the inability to be perfect. It is comforting to seek and get some sort of validation, but there is a price to pay for this. The trap that people fall into is called the ‘borrowing self’ where they depend on others' reassurances. This can take the form of texting friends for their input, copying their choice, asking a partner to validate a decision, or even doing what the experts are saying.
Title: Espace The Need For Outside Validation Content: To wean off the dependence on other people’s validation, we need to ask ourselves the following:Can I be responsible for myself today?If I was to complete only one task, what would I do?What solid evidence would there be to prove my productivity for the day?Can I strengthen an important relationship today?
Title: The Need For Validation Never Really Goes Away Content: We will continue to seek the help of other people to get overcome difficult times, and that's ok.  But we shouldn’t let that overpower our ability to think for ourselves.  There is great ease in knowing that your life reflects what’s most important to you.
