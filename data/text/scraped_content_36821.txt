Title: Poison as reflection of medicine - I Content: Medicine and poison are like two sides of a coin when one really puts it out on paper.Poison is used to kill, sedate, numb, and put to rest; all some form or the other used in modern-day medicine as bioweapons, anesthesia, and processes defined for euthanizing living beings, be it human, animal, bird or plant life.Putting light into the thought that when present, we, as beings; are ironically and very paradoxically are, living and dying at the same time.So, we understand that the study of dying is equally important as the study of living, from this very paradox.
Title: Poison as reflection of medicine - II Content: Therefore ancient Ayurveda and Atharva Veda both included the study of this vital side of healing as well, i.e. poison.Measured poisons of many varying kinds at specific doses were studied, to treat major ailments that posed a long-term threat to the solar body that we house.As discussed in the earlier piece, we know that the observer’s role is grounded, pure, and without judgment. When one thinks of science as a discipline, it is simply an art that tries to define consciousness through varied sub-disciplines.Biology is one such beautiful sub-discipline that studies plant and animal life in detail and this has led to the taxonomy and record of the millions of kinds of manifestations of life force that have been present, are present, and also try and predict possible genetic combinatorics for the future.

Title: Poison as reflection of medicine - IV Content: There is always an anomaly in the ultimate order of things and that is how it will always work as well, and similarly, we see that anomaly in the snake kingdom for just one particular species.The king of all poisons, the King Cobra .Majestic and ever so spectacular, this marvelous creation has been named Ophiophagus hannah and rightly so.Ophiophagus as a word meaning itself is that it is the snake that eats other snakes .
