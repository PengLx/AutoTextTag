Title: Lower accountability Content: Procrastinating is even easier when you have no one looking over your shoulder. Lower accountability can make procrastination more likely at home.And without the whole context of an office, it’s much easier to postpone or dismiss altogether unpleasant tasks. Those who have a lower frustration tolerance are much more likely to procrastinate: they’re the people who get up from their desk and find a distraction.
Title: High tolerance to frustration Content: People with high frustration tolerances are the ones that generally succeed at remote work.  And you can take steps to raise your frustration tolerance and become more conscientious by working on your impulsivity.A non-conscientious person will find another activity (a distraction most likely) the moment something challenging or uncomfortable comes up. They have to be more conscious to stay in the moment: count to five or take five deep breaths, for example.
Title: A lack of boundaries Content: When work and personal activities are occurring in the same space, there are no cues for you to behave the way you do at work while you are outside your physical office.Those who work well from home create boundaries in a work-life world without them. Then, once these parameters are established, people who commit fewer ‘boundary violations’ are better off.
Title: Introverts and extroverts in home office Content: Extroverted people may have a more difficult time working from home without the regular spontaneous office chats.Remote working is not necessarily heaven for an introvert either. Even though they may thrive working alone, introverts can find video calls difficult due to discomfort with being the sole focus of a camera as well as speaking up in group chats.
