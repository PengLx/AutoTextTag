Title: New Year's resolutions fail Content: 80% of New Year’s resolutions are broken within two months.And these tend to concern habits or behaviors we are actually determined to change. So much so that they are often recycled year after year.
Title: Going against our nature Content: Change is easier when we play our strenghts, but is going to be hardest when we are not committed and when it involves going against our nature.A hack that promises to help us can’t when it depends on us having to unlearn our deep-rooted patterns of adapting. That’s why playing to our strengths is much easier, to the point of not requiring much effort at all.
Title: Wanting change vs. wanting to change Content: Most people don't really want to change, they want to have changed.When people profess a clear desire to change, that usually means they are interested inchange as an outcome rather than change as a process.
Title: Change and our environments Content: The mere thought of change is threatening and frightening, which is why we gravitate toward the familiar and are generally happier with the devil we know.We make our environments as predictable as possible
Title: Personalities and change Content: Our personality constrains our ability to change,limiting our likelihood of replacing old habits with new ones.This is not to say that people can’t change, but they either become exaggerated versions of their earlier selves, or follow a common maturity curve that makes them less open to new experiences.
