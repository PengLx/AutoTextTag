Title: Meditation fosters mindfulness Content: “[Meditation] is not about clearing the mind; it’s about focusing on one thing. When the mind wanders, the meditation isn’t a failure. Our brain is like a wayward puppy, out of control. Catching it and putting it back to the object of focus is the mediation.” -- Brooks, director of the Austin Psychology and Assessment Center
