Title: The nervous system consists of two parts Content: The central nervous system (CNS). It includes the brain and spinal cord.The peripheral nervous system (PNS). It includes all the nerves that branch out from the brain and spinal cord and extends to other parts of the body, including muscles and organs.
Title: The main role of the PNS Content: The PNS's primary role is to connect the CNS to the organs, limbs, and skin. The peripheral nervous system is divided into two parts:The somatic nervous system. It is responsible for carrying sensory and motor information to and from the CNS. The automatic nervous system. It is responsible for regulating involuntary body functions, such as heartbeat, digestion, breathing, and blood flow.
Title: The Somatic Nervous System Content: The somatic system is responsible for transmitting sensory information as well as voluntary movement. The system contains two major types of neurons:Motor neurons. They carry information from the brain and spinal cord to muscle fibers throughout the body. They allow us to take physical action.Sensory neurons. They allow us to take in sensory information and then carry the information from the nerves to the central nervous system.
Title: The Autonomic Nervous System Content: The autonomic system controls aspects of the body that are usually not under voluntary control. The autonomic system is divided into two branches:Parasympathetic system: It helps maintain normal body functions and conserve physical resources. Once a threat is over, this system will slow the heart rate, slow the breathing, reduce blood flow to muscles, and constrict the pupils.Sympathetic system: This system prepares the body to expend energy to respond to environmental threats - the flight or fight response.
