Title: The ‘Backwards Law’ Content: When we expect something positive and have a desire for something good, that very experience of want, or to covet, is in a way, a negative experience for us.Referred to as the ‘Backwards Law’ by the modern philosopher Alan Watts, pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack the same right now.Example: The more we want to be rich, the more we realize that we aren’t rich, and the feeling of lack and unworthiness comes to the surface, even if you are otherwise not poor at all.
Title: The Interpretation Of The Truth Content: Not being ambitious or aspirational is looked down upon to any normal person, but if the person is grateful, the life that is led is a happier, more fulfilled one.Pain and failure, according to Mark Manson, provide us with positive results:The hardships our body endures in a gym results in us getting into a better shape.The failures in our career and business provide us with the necessary life lessons to be successful much beyond what we had hoped for.

We must then act according to our values, and not according to the fluctuating, vulnerable and unreliable emotions. One of the values can be deep gratitude.
