Title: About Fear Content: Most people are in the dark about their fears. The unknown, random and unwanted scenarios or events that could happen in the future, forms the general anxiety known as fear. This can include a fear of losing oneâ€™s job, getting sick with a virus, or getting old.Some fears are in our deep, subconscious minds, and include the fear of not being in control, of not being good enough, and even some collective fears passed on from our ancestors.
Title: The Colours Of Fear Content: Fear has the tendency to divide and isolate us, to shrink us to a tiny version of ourselves. Other negative emotions like jealousy, resentment, anger, bitterness and self-pity also have their roots in fear.Some fear is good, like staying away from things or activities that can endanger us, but most fear is psychological and a false shadow inside our heads.
Title: Fear Is A Belief Content: We try to attribute our fears to outside circumstances and falsely believe that by changing things we can get rid of our fears. Fear is just a belief inside our heads, a mindset that has gone in the darkness.Like with all beliefs, we can retrain our mind and remove our fears.
