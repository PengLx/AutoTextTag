Title: Taking Things Personally Content: Most of us take any adverse, awkward or even an accidental situation where there has been neglect, offence or betrayal, in a personal manner and feel hurt. This is mainly because of our ego, which needs acknowledgement and importance.If we stop taking things personally, others lose their power over us, and we are free to experience harmony and connection between us and the world; we can focus our energy on positive stuff, rather than on the continuous negative spiral that we get entrapped in.
Title: Strategies For Not Taking It Personally Content: Understand that it is not about you: Wanting respect and recognition is the handiwork of our ego, and what other people think, say or do has many other factors, apart from you.Give yourself some empathy: By speaking up and opening up with the other person in a polite way, one can clarify what one feels without any blame or accusation.
