Title: Moving Together In Sync Content: The synchronicity that is created while moving together in a simultaneous and coordinated manner results in strong social bonding, and well-being, according to new research.Activities like the parading, line dancing and crew rowing, which usually have synchronous movements, allows humans to bond together all at once.Even in the animal kingdom, birds, dolphins, and fireflies synchronize their actions, displaying coordinated behaviour.
Title: Spontaneous Synchronicity Content: We tend to sync ourselves with others without even realizing it. People wave or clap at the same time in concerts, rocking in sync. A study showed that if two people are in a rocking chair, they will automatically start rocking it in sync with each other.This silent conversation of movement results in a special bonding and closeness towards each other. This results in people liking each other, being generous and cooperative towards each other, reducing racial or economical bias. This behaviour is even seen in small children.
Title: Dancing Together Since Ancient Times Content: Early humans devised ways to be and stay together using the same techniques, albeit unconsciously. Voices and body movements synced together during traditional folk dances in various cultures helped people bond together.
Title: The Brainâ€™s Reward Center And Synced Movement Content: Moving together in sync released endorphins, the feel-good hormones that are the neurochemical adhesive of human relations.The reward centre of the brain, the right caudate, is stimulated and creates a positive feedback loop among the people in sync.
