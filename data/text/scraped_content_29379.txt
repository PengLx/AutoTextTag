Title: The Value of a Shared Culture Content: Having a shared culture (created by us) is one of the reasons for our possibility to connect with each other.  This culture is formed by the pieces of information related to our group values, how the members conduct themselves, and where they want to go: companies, families, movements etc, all have a culture.This culture is what keeps us together, but it is also what keeps us apart: nearly all cultures are formed around differences - by highlighting what it is about them that is different, and by using that to attack each other.
Title: The Culture Of Individual Relationships Content: The culture built in an individual relationship is more open and meaningful than a group culture, because it gives the possibility for differences to exist without them getting in the way.When we're developing individual friendships, weâ€™re setting up tacit, but dynamic rules for these relationships (with each conversation and shared experience we go through). This creates organic connections and sets the rule for the future - every future communication we have will be defined by the rules and the context set by our past communications.
Title: When Happiness Is Related To Other People Content: Happiness is related to the connections and the relationships we form - they define and shape us.If happiness and fulfillment rely on the quality of our relationships, then we all need to prioritize the act of understanding and nurturing our shared cultures.
