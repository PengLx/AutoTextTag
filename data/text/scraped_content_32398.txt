Title: The concept of creativity Content: The main idea to the concept of creativity is that some people see more possibilities than others.One way creativity is measured is by using divergent thinking tasks where you are required to produce as many uses as possible from simple objects.The aspect of our personality that appears to direct our creativity is called 'openness to experience.'The curiosity of people high in openness may lead them to see more than the average person.
Title: Creative vision Content: Research found that open people don't just bring a different perspective, they really see things differently.A visual perception phenomenon is called binocular rivalry - where two different images are presented to each eye simultaneously, such as a red patch to the right eye and a green to the left eye. The observer will flip between seeing one patch, then the other. Open people see both images at once, creating a fused or scrambled image.
Title: Seeing things that others miss Content: Inattentional blindness is a perceptual phenomenon. People experience this when they are so focused on one thing that they fail to see something else.Your susceptibility to inattentional blindness depends on your personality; open people are more likely to see things that others overlook.
Title: Opening our minds Content: Personalities are not fixed, and people with uncreative personalities can broaden the limited views.Openness also increases for students who choose to study overseas. But openness has been linked to aspects of mental illness, such as a tendency to hallucinate.
