Food,Health
Title: A misunderstood concept Content: “Diet” is one of the most used words when it comes to lose or gain weight, and this is the biggest problem of all.Everybody wants quick and easy, but following a diet plan that you don’t enjoy for a short period of time won’t do any good on your health and definitely it will not make you healthier
Title: It’s not a diet, It’s a lifestyle Content: The key to achieving and maintaining a healthy body isn't about short-term dietary changes. It's about a lifestyle that combines balanced eating habits with daily exercices or any sort of activity.
Title: Always be in control Content: If you don’t like what you are eating, just don’t eat it.You can “fool” yourself for a week, a month or even more, but on the long run, eating food that you don’t like may do more harm than good.
Title: Being healthy is simpler than you may believe Content: Start by doing any kind of activity that requires physical effort. It doesn’t have to be anything major, you can start with daily walks and build your way up 🚶‍♂️Second, you must be aware of what you eating. You don’t have to eat only chicken and salads everyday, but neither oreos cookies 🍪Finally and the most important, you have to be consistent and pacient. Healthy habbits are developed overtime and don’t forget, Rome was not built in a day either.
