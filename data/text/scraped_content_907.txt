Title: Addressing problems directly  Content: ...without crossing the line:Don’t make assumptions: make sure you have all the facts.Make sure your conversation serves a purpose: proving a point isn’t a productive goal.Plan out what you’re going to say: wording is everything, and that needs preparation.Address the phenomenon, not the person.Aim for a positive outcome: propose potential solutions.
