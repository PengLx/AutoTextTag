Title: The Blame Game Content: Whenever something doesn't go as we planned it, we often look for something or someone to put the blame. It's our primal instinct and it's a habit that can make us difficult to deal with.There are many reasons as to why we "play" the blame game. It could either be because it's easier to blame someone else than to accept responsibility or because it's an excellent defense mechanism.
Title: How to stop blaming your partner when things go wrong Content: There are two ways to change this habit:Keep in mind that what your partner does is not personal (so don't take it that way) and more often than not, things just don't go according to plan.Instead of pushing blame towards your partner, make it an opportunity to let them take accountability by communicating your raw emotional experience. This sounds like "I felt ...., when you did... ."The key is to notice this instinct and then shift blame by remembering the steps above.
