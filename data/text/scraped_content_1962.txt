Title: Mind The Limitations Of Your Brain Content: Decide important things early in the day, else decision fatigue sets in.Have snacks to keep your glucose high, else your brain will respond more strongly to immediate rewards.Sleeping or working on something else let’s you unconsciously work on complex problems.Consider options in a foreign language and look at them as if you were somebody else.Treat yourself for making a choice that benefits you more long-term instead.When making choices about the future, we tend to assume that how we feel now is how we’ll feel forever.
Title: Listen To Your Body Content: As reaction to panic or stress the body pumps adrenaline, making you breath faster and certain parts of the body feel tight, that makes us prone to often incorrect snap judgments. When having that kind of response, close your eyes, take a few breaths, and take some time to consider your next action.That buys you time to physically calm down enough to make a more considered choice.
Title: Other Tips For Better Choices Content: Be skeptic, meditate, learn from previous mistakes, know what the data and it’s context means, and trust your informed judgment.Focus on the quality of information you’re getting, not the quantity.Set a time limit for yourself, and ensure you’re not using your decision-making angst as a procrastination device.If you see that you prefer familiar and easier choices, ensure they aren’t being reframed to support something you wish was true.Crisp, clear decisions may seem like the best kind of decisions, but they may cost you time and extra effort when often the details may not even matter.Forcing yourself to choose may lead to you making high-risk decisions and ignoring alternatives.Imagine the effort you’re considering was a fantastic success, and then that it was an unequivocal disaster. Then, analyze the reasons for both to find blind spots, dampen excessive optimism, and bridge the gap between short-term and long-term thinking.
