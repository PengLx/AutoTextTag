Title: Self-Managing Our Priorities Content: We need to take ownership and set priorities of the existing workload ourselves.Our priorities can be divided into:The work that one is passionate about, and have build-in motivation for.One's contribution, taking into account the company's needs.
Title: Prioritize Your Work Content: Prioritize the tasks with the highest value addition and impact, while being in your 'high passion' list.Tolerate tasks that may be important but stress you out, as they may be part of the deal. It is also good to push yourself out of the comfort zone.Elevate tasks that others don't see as important, but you are extremely motivated about.Delegate all procedural, low-value and low-energy tasks to someone else. If that is not possible, try to minimize or eliminate such work.
Title: Flag Your Priorities Content: Take ownership and reclaim your time, choosing where you can best spend your time and energy.You can analyze your last month's calendar and flag or grade your work and in which quadrant you have been working. This will help you plan in a more informed way to use the finite resources of time and energy.
