Title: Strategy For An Optimal Life: The Six-Spokes Theory Content: The Six-Spokes Theory divides our life into a wheel with six spokes, where all of them have to be tight and function smoothly. The aim is to lead a balanced and optimal life, and is not tied to the traditional idea of success.The Spokes are as follows:Body: Your energy levels, diet, stamina, and strength.Mind: The ability to focus and learn.Love: The quality of relationships.Work: A meaningful and financially rewarding career.Money: How you utilize money.Play: Your recreational options.
Title: Neglecting The Spokes Content: The balance of life is temporarily fine if one of the spoke is neglected, but if there is a constant neglecting of a spoke of the wheel of life, one will see the consequences of the same.Example: Not exercising for a week is a temporary neglection of the ‘body’ spoke, but not exercising at all will lead to illnesses and lack of energy.
Title: Energy Is More Important Than Time Content: Most of us spend our whole day working, leaving us with less energy for other important areas of life.In the Six Spokes Theory, the work spoke is just as important as your love spoke or your play spoke, and everything matters.One has to spend the same amount of energy in each spoke, as a thumb rule.The Six-spoke theory is all about smart consumption of our limited energy, along with the best use of the limited number of hours we have during the day.
