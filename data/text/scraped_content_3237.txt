Title: Enjoy intelligent company Content: Being in the company of intelligent people will indirectly make you want to continue developing your own intelligence.
Title: Read Content: Well-read people aren't just articulate--they also have a vast pool of knowledge and an always-evolving mind.Reading improves your vocabulary, expands your communication skills and develops your analytical abilities.
Title: Rest Content: A lack of sleep, relaxation, and excessive stress can diminish your brain's capacity. The brain requires plenty of energy to function, so if you're exhausted all the time, your mind simply won't have the ability to learn and improve.
Title: Eat brain food Content: Food is fuel for the body, but it does matter what kind of fuel you are using.High nutrition foods work well to power up your brain. Walnuts are a great source of brain food, so is fish; tuna, mackerel, salmon contain rich, fatty acids that have been proven to help neurons function.
Title: Play brain games Content: Your brain needs to face challenges, to push its limits to make progress.Try brain games like memory games, Sudoku, word puzzles, and problem-solving games. I love escape rooms that make you think on the fly, and under a timeline. They will increase your pattern recognition, logic, and ability to process thought quickly. 
Title: A journaling habit Content: Taking notes or only writing down things or ideas is creating an extension of your mind.Your thoughts will be recorded, and the routine of writing them down will enable you to think more thoroughly and improve your way of thinking.
