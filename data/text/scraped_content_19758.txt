Title: History of the Diderot Effect Content: The French philosopher Denis Diderot became a wealthy man at age 52 and was able to afford small indulgences.He started with a scarlet robe and continued with other items, because they were not matching the elegance of that robe. The joy of everything he bought was short-lived. Piece by piece, Diderot replaced every item in his home.
Title: When the Diderot Effect loosens its grip Content: We live better lives than Denis Diderot and his peers and yet we always crave for more. We decide our refrigerator isnâ€™t nice enough; not when the latest models are wifi-enabled with touch screens.But our situation is more forgiving. We can always simplify. We can downsize into modest homes. We can shop less and give away more.
