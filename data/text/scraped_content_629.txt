Title: Building routines for the non-work parts of the day Content: When you have a pre-existing routine, it’s easier to fit work into it when it arises. If you’re working from home on a regular basis, it’s good to get into a habit of showering and getting dressed, because it provides some parameters that say, ‘Work day has begun!’
Title: Routines reduce mental fatigue Content: They tell your brain what’s expected of it:They reduce decision fatigue and that fight-or-flight stress that can get in the way of taking action.They help you cultivate the “flow” state that leads to radical productivity.
Title: Work structure Content: Develop a reserve of cues that tell your brain it’s time for work and outline a structure you can tap into whenever you need to get down to business.For example, work from the same place (and do nothing but work there) or listen to the same music or background noise.
Title: Routines are a personal thing Content: There’s actually limited value in reading about the exact routine of Steve Jobs or Albert Einstein - what worked for them isn’t likely to be the key to your productivity.You’ll see the biggest returns from a daily routine when it’s a schedule that plays to your own unique rhythms and tendencies.
