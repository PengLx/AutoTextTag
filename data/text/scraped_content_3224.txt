Adopting this mindset allows you to go from victim/perpetrator to empowered self-knowing creator.
Title: Step 1: Look For Emotional Patterns Content: We often let our emotions run through unexamined, but that robs us of valuable insight. Focus on the feeling and the context they appear so you can work towards getting rid of unhelpful patterns.
