You can be enormously creative and successful once you know how to recharge.Create a life where you can have more time by yourself.Make small incremental moves towards the life you want to live.Ask yourself throughout the day: is this activity giving me energy or draining me?Be humble enough to realize what you are not good at.Self-esteem is great if you earn it. But if you have no gas in the car, faking your gas gauge won’t make the car run longer.
