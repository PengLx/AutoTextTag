Title: Experiencing Rejection Content: For entrepreneurs, the word ‘Yes’ is an exception, not the rule. The small business landscape, where new startups are coming and going, it is common to hear rejection, with investors not interested in your product/service, or a potential customer shunning your product.But when our goals and dreams are at stake, hearing the word ‘no’ actually hurts.
Title: Coping With Rejection Content: Sticking to your commitment and progress even in the face of rejection is a good way to cope up with rejection, even if one has to blame the other party. Blaming is not a good option, but it serves the purpose if we absorb the lesson and continue trying.
Title: Don’t Take it Personally Content: Just remember that failure in one area of life does not reflect your overall self-worth and value.You have a lot going on. If the other person said ‘no’ to your proposal, or you got rejected in that interview, it is not the end of the world, just an obstacle that is providing you with valuable lessons.
Title: Push A Little Harder Content: Sometimes we move too quickly from our rejections as if the door is suddenly permanently closed. We need to not take rejection at face value right at the first go and show that we are not made of clay.Sometimes, there can be a lack of understanding between the recruiter and the candidate, and the problem can be addressed by nudging for a reconsideration.
Title: The Way To Face Rejection Content: The best way to face rejection is to succeed! Success provides you with the confidence that you are worthy and can take the occasional ‘no’, like all successful people. Improving yourself by gaining skills increases your confidence. Celebrating your small successes adds weight to it.
