Title: Put Yourself In Difficult Situations Content: You need to put yourself into positions that create immense pressure. The kind of pressure that will either make or break you. This is how you purge out your weakness and small-mindedness. It won't be pretty. But it will change you.
Title: Don't Copy Other People Content: If you're following someone else's tracks, where do you think those tracks will lead you? To your own destination or to theirs?If you don't know who you are, you'll always try to be someone else. And thus, you'll never be the best. Your work will always be a cheap imitation. It will lack the feeling that produced the work or the idea.
