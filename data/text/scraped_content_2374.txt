Title: Rejection Content: Rejection and failure and disappointment are a regular feature of ordinary life, no matter how successful someone may be.Any set of circumstances in which one reaches out for something: acceptance, approval, the good opinion of friends and familyâ€”the good opinion of anyone at all-- there is the risk and, indeed, the certainty of rejection from time to time.
Title: Keep the odds in mind Content: Know ahead of time what the chances are of a particular effort for being successful.If the odds are long, that is not a reason for not trying; it is a reason not to be discouraged by failure.For instance, sending in a resume in response to an advertised job has been studied. Approximately two percent receive a response. That is not an argument for giving up. It is a matter of the odds. Sending in a couple of hundred resumes shifts the odds in your favor.
Title: Keep more than one iron in the fire Content: Having a manuscript rejected by one publishing house is less devastating if that book is being considered at the same time somewhere else.An unsuccessful job interview does not feel so bad if another one is scheduled for tomorrow.
Title: Rejection doesn't define you Content: Rejection is not a reflection of who you are. People get turned down for every sort of thing for all kinds of reasons that have nothing to do with merit.
