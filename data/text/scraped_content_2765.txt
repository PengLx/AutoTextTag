Title: Diets are based on less Content: The whole concept of a diet is backwards, because in most cases, what society thinks of as a "diet" is based on the idea of less.The idea of deprivation, ingrained in many diets, gives us control over a situation in the short term. Itdoesn't become a habit, and 10 days — maybe two weeks — later, we see that deprivation rebound when self-control finally dwindles.
Title: How to stick to a diet Content: Make small but sustainable changes, stay away from anything extreme, and build up small changes over time.Most people would rather have a horrible 10 days of a raw, low-carb, no salt, no sugar, no water diet and return to their old habits than really have to address that $150 Frappuccino bill they're racking up each month.
Title: Make a slow change Content: Instead of jumping straight to a vegan diet, commit to two handfuls of veggies at every dinner meal, at least three days a week first. The slower change will make it more likely to last.      Instead of a 21-day sugar "cleanse," try to slowly wean yourself off of all six pumps of vanilla in your 'breakfast latte' and eventually, make yourself some eggs at home. Instead of jumping on the paleo diet trend, just clean out all the processed and packaged snacks and replace them with sliced carrots, celery, and bell peppers.
