Title: Social Comparisons Content: A social comparison happens when we are measuring ourselves by the success or the failures of others. We all use social comparisons to motivate ourselves.Upward comparisons make us dissatisfied, as we line up ourselves with someone better than us.Downward comparisons make us feel better about our status, and sometimes feel pity for the other.
Title: Compete With Yourself Content: If you find the external upward social comparisons de-motivating, it is a good idea to shift your focus inwards, and compare your past with your present, while keep pushing yourself every week, month and year. Having a written record of your performance creates a tangible comparison chart to work with.Downward comparisons help us find motivation when we are feeling low, as it gives perspective.They also provide us with an urge to help others in need, igniting our energies to mentor and support those in need.
