Title: Food affects the environment Content: Eating healthy food is almost always also the best for the environment.Researchers say poor diets seriously harm people and the planet. Foods such as fruit, vegetables, beans, and whole grains are best for avoiding disease and protecting the climate and water resources, while red and processed meat cause the most ill health and pollution.
Title: Foods that buck the trend Content: Fish is generally a healthy choice but have a bigger environmental footprint on average. High-sugar foods have a low impact on the planet but are damaging to your health.Some farming groups argue only intensively produced meat is harmful to the environment.
Title: A healthy guideline Content: Global ill-health costs from diabetes alone are similar to the total value of farming in the global economy.Researchers calculated that producing unprocessed red meat has the highest impact on all environmental indicators.Food with medium environmental impacts or not associated with ill health, such as refined grain cereals, dairy, eggs, and chicken, could help improve health and reduce environmental harm if they replace foods such as red meat.Producing a reasonable guideline for a healthy and sustainable diet would put the world and its people in a much better place.
