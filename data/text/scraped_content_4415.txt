Title: Unfinished Books Content: Due to unlimited distractions, shorter attention spans and increased boredom, we aren't finishing the books we start to read. Our impulsive and fickle nature is also to blame.
Title: Add Some Variety Content: The mind needs variety and diverse types of stimuli at different times. Reading several books at once, of different genres is a smart way to be able to cater to the mind's different needs at different times. It is also a good idea to not have more than a few books in your current reading list. The recommended number is 3.
Title: Let Go Of Certain Books Content: If reading a certain book is beginning to feel like a burden to you, you are free to let go. The reason can be any, but it is no use wasting your time in a book that isn't speaking to you.Letting go of a book provides closure and unburdens your mind.
Title: Read With Context Content: Books have context and their words can work better when a certain book has the right time and place. Choosing the right book at the right time is a great way to ensure it is finished. This can also work as a cue for us to pick up a certain book at a specific time or place.It also helps to remove any distractions from your reading place, to make reading easy and accessible. Having your phone or TV around you isn't going to help you read.
Title: Build A Routine and Follow it Content: Planning out and putting your reading time in a calendar can help you read regularly. Find out at what time of the day you have 15 to 30 minutes and develop a routine to read at that time.If you can muster 30 minutes daily for reading, it can be extremely beneficial in the long run. With perseverance, you can build a great reading habit.
