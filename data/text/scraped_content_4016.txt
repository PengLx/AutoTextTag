Title: Sadness as a Person Content: A study found that people feel less sad if the feeling of sadness is personified, as it leads to a certain distance between the person and the emotion.
Title: Detached from Sadness Content: By imagining that Sadness is a person, the sad person becomes detached from his/her sadness.They can picture the sadness to have human traits or mannerisms, leading to an internal regulation of that particular emotion.
Title: Not for the other Emotions Content: While this approach of humanizing the emotion appears to work for sadness, it can make a happy person less happy, if that feeling is humanized.Other complex emotions like guilt and embarrassment may have any kind of effect and are yet to be studied.
