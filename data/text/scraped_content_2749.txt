Title: Zen In The Arts Content: Zen has no goal. A world that focuses on destinations, that only cares about getting somewhere as fast as possible, becomes a world without substance.Zen is a liberation from time. If we open our eyes and see clearly, it becomes obvious that there is no other time than this instant, and that the past and future are abstractions without any concrete reality.
Title: Satori And The Koan Content: Satori,enlightenment, is not a sudden complete awakening, it is the sudden and intuitive way of seeing into anything. The satori is not a feeling of relaxation, though, it is letting go but not feeling it.The koan is a way of stressing the mind into having to relax and release itself. Like increasing muscular tension to give yourself a feeling of what not to do.
Title: Of Zen And Focus Content: Zen spirituality is to be in the moment and do only what you are doing without giving in to fleeting thoughts.When a human is so self-controlled, that he cannot let go of himself, he dithers or wobbles between opposites. The effort to remain “good” or “happy” necessitates such strenuous balancing that it will surely induce mania and anxiety.
Title: Considerations For Zen Practice  Content: Understand that nothing is grasped or gained from life. To succeed is to fail, as the more one succeeds, the greater the need to go on succeeding.There is no “myself” apart from the mind-body which gives structure to our experience.There is never anything but the present, and if one cannot live there, one cannot live anywhere.Zen practice must not have a goal. To have an eye on some end is to have a lack of concentration, lack of sincerity.
