Title: When to Study Content: Studying time is more efficient if it is spread out over many sessions throughout the semester, with a little extra right before the exam.Cover each piece of info five times from when you first learn it until your exam. It will enable you to retain the information with minimal effort.
Title: What and How to Study Content: Testing yourself, so you have to retrieve the information from memory, works much better than repeatedly reviewing the information, or creating a concept map (mind map).After the first time learning the material, spend the subsequent studying to recalling the information, solving a problem or explaining the idea without glancing at the source.
Title: What Kinds of Practice to Do Content: For a particular exam, use the following:Mock tests and exams that are identical in style and form.Redo problems from assignments, textbook questions or quizzes.Generate your own questions or writing prompts based on the material.
Title: Make Sure You Really Understand Content: Passing and failing rest on whether you understood some important ideas.Your top priority should be to understand the core concepts. Identify the core concepts and make sure you can explain them without looking at the material.
Title: Overcome Anxiety Content: Anxiety makes it difficult to remember things. To help overcome this, make some of your studying sessions like a mock exam, using the same seating posture, materials, and the same time constraints.
