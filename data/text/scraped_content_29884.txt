Title: The One Thing We Can Control: Ourselves Content: Self-control is a necessary and much sought-after skill in this increasingly complex world. There are a million distractions, multiple stress-inducing outlets and a chronic lack of sleep for most of us, and self-control becomes the only bandwidth that we have.People who are reactive will find self-control challenging, as compared to resilient and conscientious individuals.
Title: Two Ways To Boost Self-Control Content: Form better habits: you can practice self-control on a daily basis by switching off the phone when you need to sleep or work, walking more, and getting to bed early to be able to wake up early.Reframing your thinking: also called cognitive reappraisal, it essentially means broadening your perspective beyond the present moment.
Title: Self-Control And Mental Distancing Content: By using a third-person point of view, you create a psychological distance between you and the ‘object of your temptation’.Studies prove that this quirky practice of talking to yourself decreases anxiety and stress.
Title: Creating An Alter Ego Content: A new identity, even if only in our imagination, makes us mentally transform into that person and imbibe their habits, and working style.When kids pretend to be their favorite characters, they are able to regulate their emotions and manage their frustration.Adults can use this ‘alter ego’ method to channel someone who is competent for the task at hand.
Title: Time Travelling And Your Future Self Content: Thinking about past challenges that were resolved by us helps us get into the ‘glory’ mode and reclaim it in the present, along with envisioning a future point in time when things will be better.Imagining our future self makes us harder to take the bait of instant gratification, and helps us identify the various challenges and obstacles that are inevitable.
