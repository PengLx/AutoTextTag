Title: Shortcuts to smarter thinking Content: With time, our brains develop clever artifices to help solve common problems.  These repeated concepts are called heuristics: algorithms, procedures or rules of thumb that simplify decision making. When we rely on heuristics for making decisions and solving problems, we save mental energy for complex or high-level decisions.
Title: The problem with heuristics Content: The problem with using this appears we rely too much on using our existing heuristic patterns without modifying them, because that can create a state of mental stagnation. Mental operations are affected by mistakes such as cognitive biases, if we are not careful.
Title: Understanding the bigger picture Content: We like to be right. And to protect our desire to be right, we look for evidence that supports our ideas and ignore evidence that contradicts them.  But to construct a holistic view about anything, we have to aim to understand the big picture and be particularly critical of sources that support our beliefs.
Title: Comfortable with feeling uncomfortable Content: In the long-term, comfort is bad for your brain.Seeking new experiences, learning new skills, and opening the door to new ideas inspire us and educate us in a way that improves mental clarity.
Title: Cultivate your curiosity Content: Curiosity is the force that activates and sustains lifelong learning. A naturally curious mind takes interest in a wide range of subjects to find connections to help solve everyday problems better.
