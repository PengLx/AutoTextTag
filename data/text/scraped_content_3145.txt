Title: Dealing with intrusive thoughts Content: While we can’t control the feelings and thoughts that pop into our heads, we can control what we do with them.But we don't have to fight them, we just have to find better methods to handle them.
Title: The internal trigger Content:  Look for the discomfort that comes before the distraction.Focus on the internal trigger that precedes the unwanted behavior, like feeling anxious, having a craving, feeling restless, or thinking you are incompetent.
Title: Write down the trigger Content: Write down the trigger, the time of day, what you were doing, and how you felt when you noticed the internal trigger that led to the distracting behavior. The better we are at noticing the behavior, the better we’ll be at managing it over time.
Title: Explore your sensations Content: Get curious about the sensations you're feeling (fingers that twitch, butterflies in your stomach etc). And stay with the feeling before acting on the impulse.
Title: Beware of liminal moments Content: These are thetransitions from one thing to another throughout our days (like picking up your phone while waiting for a traffic light then finding yourself still looking at your phone while driving).What’s dangerous is that by doing them “for just a second,” you’re likely to do things you'll later regret.
Title: The 'ten-minute rule' Content: If you find yourselfwanting to check your phone when you can’t think of anything better to do, tell yourself it’s fine to give in, but not right now: you have to wait just ten minutes.It helps you deal with all sorts of potential distractions, like googling something rather than working or eating something unhealthy when you're bored.
