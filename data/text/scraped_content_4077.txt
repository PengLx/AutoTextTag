Title: Planning for the unexpected Content: Many of us have very well laid-out to-do lists any daily plans. However, they do not reflect the reality of our everyday working life.We will always be interrupted. If our mindset is to accept that we will always have interruptions and surprises, we will be less frustrated when they happen.
Title: The specifics of your job Content: We let our planning focus on the tasks associated with the job. But we don't take into account all the aspects of our job.Interacting with people can be part of the broader scope of your job. It means that interruptions are not actually non-productive aspects. They are actions that should get folded into the plan for each day.
Title: Blocks of time Content: Some interruptions cannot be avoided. But, we can talk to people in advance about the best times to pop in. We can also schedule a time when we will not be available and would prefer not to be disturbed.
Title: Being realistic Content: When creating a to-do list and interruptions at odd times are a given, build a buffer time in for each task. Assume an hour-long project will take 90 minutes. Schedule extra time into your calendar each day for your team to "pop in."
