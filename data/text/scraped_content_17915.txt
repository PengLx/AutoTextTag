Title: Herd Mentality Content: As human beings, we are made to learn and adopt a set of beliefs, never to be questioned. We develop automatic systems that get accustomed to a way of thinking and living, and anything that counters our beliefs is deemed false.Blindingly following instructions and doing what all others are doing is a form of herd mentality and is devoid of any real thinking.
Title: Think For Your Life Content: Instead of following the so-called experts, the recommendations of artificial intelligence and the advice given on news channels, we need to think for our own life, using common sense, logic, gut instinct, experience and our environmental cues.We need to keep our eyes and ears open, not to be led by people who themselves do not know what to do and are only following an agenda.
Title: Diverse Opinions Content: While we need to consume less social media, doing a diverse set of readings is probably a good idea to broaden our view, and specialization in this age is something that is increasingly like a horse with blinders.The trick is to question everything and stay well-informed and unbiased.
Title: Drowning In Information Content: The deluge of information, opinions, data, choice makes us create tremendous amounts of anxiety in us to maximize and optimize our choices to perfection, and we are better off by ‘satisficing’ being content with our less than perfect choice, and makes us lead more fulfilling lives.
Title: Perspectives Content: Everyone’s perspectives are just that, limited world-views which are biased, incomplete and discriminatory.We need to bridge the mind-gap and see the world through the eyes of other people, leading to an active adoption of other people's perspectives.
