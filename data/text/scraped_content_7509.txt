Title: We were all children Content: Keeping this in mind is not nostalgia, but rather an embrace of all that has gone into making up a full-grown human being.The past is part of who we are. We are made up of imagination and memory and dearly-won virtues.
Title: Disproportionate pursuits Content: Adults aren't disappointing because they have grown bigger, or got jobs, or taken on responsibilities.Adults are disappointing because we have forgotten how to see the world as it actually is. We see people as statistics, education as functional, food as fuel, clothing as utilitarian, religion as morality.We over-value what we can experience with the senses. We work over our books, counting everything up, claiming ownership, and fail to see that we live in a whole, wild universe.
Title: Invisible bond of love Content: “People have forgotten this truth,” the fox said. “But you mustn’t forget it. You become responsible forever for what you’ve tamed. You’re responsible for your rose.” -Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little PrinceTo have perfect love, we have to become children again and learn how to trust and give all we have to the beloved. But we must also be aware that love brings with it responsibility. 
Title: Daring to love Content: If we care for one another, we deny ourselves and may even sometimes get hurt. It is worth the risk. The cost of not daring to love is to miss the point of our existence entirely.
Title: The well in the desert Content: “What makes the desert beautiful,” said the little prince, “is that somewhere it hides a well…”- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little PrinceTo the Little Prince, the desert is not about the harsh realities of survival or what the eye can see. A desert is a place of beauty because somewhere, somewhere hidden amongst the piles of sand there is a spring, and this hidden water, in turn, provides beauty and life and love to the weary ship-wrecked travelers.
