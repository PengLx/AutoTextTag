Title: Commitment Issues Content: Many people have unrealistic expectations of dieting, viewing it as a temporary solution, seeking immediate results, or resorting to exotic and extreme fad diets.Balance and moderation should be your motto, and you should never give up. Good health practices become a habit and a way of life.
Title: Inadequate Sleep Content: Sleep helps maintain a healthy balance of the hormones that make you feel hungry (ghrelin) or full (leptin).When you don’t get enough sleep, your level of ghrelin goes up and your level of leptin goes down; this makes you feel hungrier than when you’re well-rested.Get 7-8 hours of sleep around the same time each night and you will be ready to seize the day.
Title: Poor Timing of Meals Content: Irregular eating schedules have subtle, yet traceable negative health effects and are associated with increased risks of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and inflammation.Simply by staying in sync with your circadian rhythm will facilitate weight loss. Try eating breakfast every day within one hour of waking up, then having a healthy snack or meal every three to four hours.
Title: Underestimating Calories Consumed Content: By keeping an honest diet journal, you can begin to have a better awareness of your calorie intake. Dieters who keep a daily food diary tend to lose twice as much weight as those who do not.There are many other important factors to consider in choosing your next meal. For example, if the food you eat contains fiber, it will keep you feeling full longer, which can prevent you from reaching for “extra” calories in order to fill yourself up.
Title: Overestimating Calories Burned Content: By incorporating a little exercise whenever possible — such as choosing to walk or bike instead of driving, or taking the stairs instead of the elevator — you will burn calories and slowly build up stamina.If you’re timing your meals right and getting enough sleep, you should have plenty of rest and energy to burn more calories than you’re consuming.
