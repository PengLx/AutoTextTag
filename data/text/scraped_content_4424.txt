Title: How our brains process information Content: Our brains process information in two ways:Fast: Our fast brain is highly efficient, and makes decisions automatically by focusing on a few details it finds important, based on past experience.Slow: Our slow brain uses control processing to make decisions, and takes into account more information. Our brains spend most of their time in fast mode. However, we should avoid relying on our fast brain when we are in a new situation or when we are under stress.
