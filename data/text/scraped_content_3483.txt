Title: Make an outline Content: Having a clear sense of structure in mind when you start writing is really helpful.So make sure you generate an outline. Start by making a list of the various sections you think you’ll need in your writing project. You can reorder them later. After that, make a list of the more specific elements you need in each section.
Title: Just get something down Content: Don't get stuck in the process of trying to find the perfect words. Start by drafting something.Write down a bunch of sentences that relate to the outline you constructed. Then, you can go back and edit, to get rid of everything that doesn’t fit.
Title: Write for five more minutes Content: When you feel the urge to quit writing, tell yourself that you’re going to write for five more minutes.You might even get a second wind and write for more than five minutes.
