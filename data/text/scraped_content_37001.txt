Title: Best Rule For Success: Step Out From Your Comfort Zone Content: “If you always do what you’ve always done, you’ll always get what you’ve always got.”“Growth is often painful and scary. There is no growth without change; there is no change without fear or loss; and there is no loss without pain. Every change involves a loss of some kind: You must let go of old ways in order to experience the new. We fear these losses, even if our old ways were self-defeating, because, like a worn out pair of shoes, they were at least comfortable and familiar.”Get rid of all of the negative beliefs you’ve accumulated.Stop blaming your boss, your coworkers, the government, the economy, etc.
