Title: Practice Self-Denial Content: Purposely deny yourself basic modern privileges, like meals, a cup of coffee or your weekend treat.This helps you build up self-control and reminds you to appreciate what you have, which helps put the things you’re anxious about in perspective. Both gratitude and self-control are required to manage stress at its root instead of just dealing with it as it comes up.
