Love & Relationships,Personal Development
Title: Do something meaningful together Content: Connection-deepening activities are ones that get you focused on each other as people — and on your relationship.Take a scenic drive to get ice cream, clean the tub together, or take a cooking class.
Title: Be curious Content: Appreciating the why of where your intimate partner is coming from is a powerful means of building empathy (without giving up your own opinion) and empathy is deeply intimate.Making the effort to understand another person demonstrate a deep degree of caring even in the context of disagreement.
Title: Be available in a new way Content: Surprise them by agreeing to take care of a chore you usually protest/avoid; offer to accompany them on something you usually take a pass on; or surprise them with something they care about.Surprise generosity is a huge intimacy booster.
Title: Make a “Nice” list Content: Try sitting down individually or with your partner and creating gratitude or “Nice” lists, detailing as many things as possible that you appreciate and/or enjoy about your partner.Even if you do it on your own, it will help you refocus on points of connection that drew you to them initially and regardless of all the irritations we inevitably face in the course of intimate relationships.
Title: Invest in yourself Content: Investing in yourself, your wellness, and your personal development are an important part of your health as a couple. When you are feeling your best and in touch with how you are thinking and feeling, you can participate more fully, mindfully, and meaningfully.
Title: Be brave, not aggressive Content: Avoidance destroys intimacy. If you and your partner are mutually or individually avoiding a challenging topic that needs to be addressed, you are slowly eating away at your connection.The vulnerability required to start a difficult conversation communicates to your partner that you are more invested in the health of the relationship than avoiding personal discomfort.
