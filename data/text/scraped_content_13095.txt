Title: Seinfeld Content: Seinfeld was more innovative than we got to know at the time we watched it. A popular show in syndicate and on Netflix, its genius production, direction and comedy geometry is marveled at even now, as more people are getting to understand it.
Title: No Lessons Content: The Show About Nothing had no moral lessons. In fact, the characters routinely made bad choices, said the wrong things, and committed a faux pas almost in every episode. They had a rule for this: No Hugging, No Learning.
Title: More Scenes Per Episode Content: In 30 odd minutes, Seinfeld packed more than 20 different scenes. Up to four different stories, which hilariously tied up with each other in the end, were thrown in the air, only to be skillfully caught by the master juggler Larry David (Co-producer and Director).
