Title: Trying vs Doing Content: Trying is not the same as doing. You either do something, or you don't.When we say we are trying, we don't have to do anything. It only provides us with an excuse for why we couldn't accomplish the outcome we desired.
Title: How to quit trying Content: Remove the word 'try' from your vocabulary. 'Try' induces the kind of behavior that leads to failure.Decide either to do or not do. If you don't want to do something, don't do it. If you do want to do something, commit to it, and make it happen.Commit 100 percent to the outcome you want. Don't quit. Don't settle for trying.
