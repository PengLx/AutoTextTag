Title: Idea 1 Content: About ten years ago, my new neighbor in Austin, Texas invited me to a meeting with a group called “Executive Success Programs, aka NXIVM.” This program was designed to “help individuals develop the emotional and intellectual skills necessary to reach their maximum potential in all areas of life.” I was intrigued by the invitation as she also had small children, a ready laugh and was beautiful, interesting, and outgoing. It didn’t take long for our entire neighborhood block to google “Executive Success” however, and warnings were emailed all around that this appeared to be a cult led by a figure known as Vanguard.
