Title: How much humans can eat Content: One study asked healthy participants to eat pizza until they felt full. Then on a separate day to eat pizza until they couldn't anymore. They ate twice as much as on the first take, suggesting that when you feel full, you're probably only half full.Blood samples were also taken at regular intervals to see how the body was coping. Despite eating twice as much food, there was only a small increase in blood sugar and blood fat levels.
Title: The effect of overeating on the body Content: Studies revealed that in physically active and healthy people, the body is able to control the sugar and fat in the blood after a big meal by working a bit harder than usual to regulate metabolism.Hormones released from the gut and pancreas help the body to regulate blood sugar levels.After participants ate past the point of feeling comfortably full, they had little desire to eat anything even four hours after the meal.The also felt sleepier and less energetic after eating too much.
Title: Long-term overeating Content: Healthy humans rely on the body's ability to work harder in times of need. However, when we repeatedly eat too many calories at each meal, metabolic syndrome - a combination of high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity - will result. Over time, the body will become unable to react to these situations.
