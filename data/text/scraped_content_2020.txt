Title: Productivity guilt Content: It’s the constant nagging feeling that you should be doing more. And if you’re not doing everything, then you’re a lazy slacker who will never reach your goals. --Scott H. YoungThat’s simply not true. Even small efforts have a cumulative effect.
Title: Be Imperfect Content: No one is perfect—not even the people you admire most. The reality is we can’t realistically implement every life hack out there.Do not worry if something falls by the wayside. Pick it up again if you think it worked. Doing it a little is better than not doing it.
Title: The Flaw Of Perfection Content: If you were to do everything you’re advised to do to have a perfect, productive life, you’d basically have no time to just be alive, no matter how efficiently executed.Separate the nice-to-have from the essential. Most advice is nice-to-have—it helps, but only a little. If you can focus on the essential things that matter for your few goals, then you can stop feeling guilty about everything else.
Title: Start Where You’re At Content: The question is never, “What should I do, ideally, to solve this problem?” Instead it’s always, “How could I do things a little differently than last time for a little better results?”The only thing you need to do is take one step: that’s productive enough.
