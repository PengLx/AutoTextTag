Title: Speed and transfer Content: Consider at what speed you should try to do things in order to improve performance.We can often learn something quickly, but without attaining a master level(like getting good at estimating answers to math problems. While you might get within close proximity, you'll seldom get to the exact answer.)Learning to do something with precision will require a different technique and can take much longer to master.
Title: Failing to Reach an Ideal Content: There are two problems you can encounter when you're trying to learn something.You have a clear understanding of what you'd like to do and how you're going to do it, but you're unable to implement the approach you've chosen. Slow things down so you can pay more attention to every aspect of the problem.Speed learning is effective when you're not sure what the ideal should be and need more information to work it out. A good example of speed leading to move closer to quality is in entrepreneurial fields. Many fail because they picked the wrong problem to solve and wasted too much time trying to solve it.
Title: Going faster vs doing it right Content: The balance between going faster and doing it right depends on what you're trying to achieve.Faster feedback means more information to find out your key challenges and possible solutions.Slowerhelps you focus on a strategy you've chosen, allowing you to execute it correctly.
