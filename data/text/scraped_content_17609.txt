Title: Permanent Assumptions Content: In this world of uncertainties, nothing but death and taxes are sureshot in our lives.There are however some assumptions that withstand the test of time. These assumptions take into account basic human psychology and historical data.
Title: The World We Live In Content: People generally want to solve problems than to create harm, but those who want to harm get a lot more attention.While people can be taken advantage of, it canâ€™t be done for an infinite period of time.Every ten years or so, there has to be some economic, political, military or social breakdown, according to historical data.
Title: Human Behaviour Content: Stories are more engaging than statistics. A thousand people dead evokes different emotions than the death of that one person whose story we all know.The only thing constant is change, and nothing good or bad stays that way, ever. However, one can never find out what or when the change would be.Incentives can make people do good and bad things. While a group of people can be made smarter, they cannot be made more patient, less greedy during uncertain periods.
Title: History Studied Upside Down Content: History is studied wrongly, while we focus on the unprecedented events (The Blips) and use that knowledge as a map of the future.Instead of studying war and invasions, history needs to be studied upside down, with an emphasis on peace and prosperity.
