Title: Pre-introduce yourself Content: Think about the people you would like to get to know and then carve out time to accomplish that goal:A few before the conference, make a 'priority wish list' of people you’d like to meet.Send those people an email introducing yourself and asking to meet; if possible, get an introduction from a mutual friend or colleague.
Title: Be strategic with your time Content: When choosing which sessions to attend, consider this:A session should fulfill either a content goal (should be educational) orIt should fulfill an interpersonal goal (you want to meet or support the person who is presenting).
