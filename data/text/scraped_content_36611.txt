Title: The benefits of getting stronger Content: While it's established that cardio and weight lifting build muscle, new research in mice shows that endurance exercise boosts the growth of vital muscle stem cells and fundamentally changes their metabolism.It is too early to translate the findings directly to people. Still, this research could inform strategies to help people bounce back from injury, resist the loss of muscle mass that comes with ageing, and gain benefits even if people can't exercise.
Title: How muscle maintenance affects longevity Content: Muscle maintenance is vital to ensure healthy ageing. In research with mice, researchers found that aerobic exercise changed how the animals consumed oxygen, metabolised sugar, and how tired they were when they weren't exercising. The mice were leaner and had fewer signs of inflammation.
Title: Cells capable of regenerating tissue Content: The research team isolated muscle tissue and focused on satellite cells - stem cells that live in skeletal muscle and regenerate muscle throughout adulthood.These cells are activated continuously, but over time become fatigued and stop renewing. Endurance exercise increases proteins involved in quieting and activating these satellite cells, which enable self-renewal or differentiation.
