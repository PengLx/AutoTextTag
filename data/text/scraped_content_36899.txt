Title: Balancing Act Content: One of the most critical things you will learn in your lifetime is how to balance reality with expectation.The Universe would like to make perfectly clear that expectation is vastly different from manifestation.Today, you are being invited to look at your expectations and see how many are valid.If you find they are not, it is time make some changes; release and begin manifesting a different reality for yourself. ~ Creator
