Title: Martial arts as a way of learning Content: In the Eastern paradigm of education, you do the application first and then the theory bubbles up. (In contrast, in the Western paradigm, the teacher first explains the theory to the student, who then applies the theory.)Practice adapting to a changing environment and then implicitly learn through that.
Title: Use Your Opponent's Force Against Them Content: To defeat an armed opponent when you yourself have no weapon or only a small weapon,you use the attacker's force against himself or herself, instead of confronting it.When something comes at you, you don't just push back against it. See everything that comes at you as an opportunity. Ask, "How can I leverage this? How can I flow with this? Where is the opportunity in this?"
Title: Mastery Takes Time and Practice Content: You can't move past the beginner level unless you first get good at the basics. You first have to practice the beginner moves 10,000 times or more.If you want to develop real competence in business, it's not about constantly looking for new things. It's about developing a deeper level of understanding, of insight, of the things you already know and do.
