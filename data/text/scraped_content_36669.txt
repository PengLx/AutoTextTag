Title: Ancient Dogs And Their Lineage Content: Chihuahuas have traces of ancient dogs found in America, while Huskies resemble their ancestors that date back at least 11000 years.The scientific study of dogs and wolves DNA reveals that wolves picked up DNA from dogs, but did not transmit any DNA to dogs, even though it is established that dogs have evolved from wolves. The reasons about the wolves with intersected dog DNA not being around, or one species of dogs completely wiping out other lineages remain a mystery.
