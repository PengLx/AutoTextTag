Title: Workflow analysis Content: Workflow analysis has 3 goals:To document and represent the workflows.To improve an existing workflow that is problematic.To optimize a smoothly operating workflow with automation.When you start analyzing your workflows, you need to consider the business process, the data attached to it,  timeframe, and frequency. 
Title: Analyzing new workflows Content: When you start to analyze the workflow for an existing process that hasn't been documented, your primary goal is to portray it using either multiple sticky notes or a workflow management software program.Early in the workflow creation process, you will spot the gaps and inefficiencies in a workflow. When the draft is sent to legal for review, ensure to assign ownership of the task to one person, then set up automated reminders for them to follow up.
Title: Improving sticky workflows Content: Once you've implemented your workflow, continue to analyze your process to see how effective it is. Metics to look at:How often the workflow is initiatedHow often it's completedHow long it takes to perform tasks in the workflowHow many times tasks are rejected or returned for further review.Analyze bottlenecks in your workflows.
Title: Optimizing smooth workflows Content: Look at ways you can improve good processes.To optimize the workflow, use the data you collected at the beginning about how long a task should take vs. how long it actually takes and other ways to measure success or failure.Model new workflows with the improvements you want to make to estimate the impact of the outcome.
