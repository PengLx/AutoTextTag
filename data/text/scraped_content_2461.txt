Title: What gratitude changes Content: Gratitude is intended to change three things: your past, your present, your future.If you’re not transforming your past, present, and future, then you aren’t fully experiencing the benefits of gratitude.
Title: Live in the gain Content: Stop focusing on what's missing from your life. And rather than measuring yourself against your ideals, measure yourself against where you were before.When you live in the gain, all you see is progress. What you focus on expands.
Title: Transform your past Content: Your past is whatever you ascribe meaning to. You can remember the gains, or you can remember the pain.Gratitude allows you to re-remember your past while being entirely focused on the gain. When you re-contextualize your past, you’ll never be the victim to your past again.
Title: Present circumstances Content: If you focus on your circumstances, you’ll find plenty to complain about. But if you focus on your capability, then your only option is to get moving.The problem isn’t actually your circumstances, but how you’re looking at them. Reframe them andconsciously focus on the good in them.
Title: Transform your future Content: Gratitude for your future allows you to know that you’ll succeed, long before you do.While most people are defined by experiences from their past, successful people are defined by experiences in their future.
