Communication
Title: Being A Great Listener Content: Focus on what’s being said instead of how it affects you or what you want to say.Put away your phone. It’s rude and multitasking takes away from comprehension.Ask follow-up and confirmation questions. This shows you’re listening and care about what’s been said.Practice reflective listening. Paraphrase in your own words the meaning of what’s being said to guarantee you’ve interpreted it correctly. By doing this, you give the speaker the opportunity to clarify what she meant to say.Use positive body language:Use an enthusiastic tone, uncross your arms, maintaining eye contact.Don’t judge. This doesn’t require that you believe or agree with them, it only means you understand.Talk less. If not checking for understanding or asking a probing question, you shouldn’t be talking.
Title: Listening influences up to 40% of a leader’s job performance Content: Beyond the spoken words, the tone of voice, body language, and what isn’t said also convey valuable information.But most people overrate their listening skills.
