Title: Always Running Content: We all are in a hurry to go somewhere, hankering something greater, better, most substantial and more significant than our present.Human beings have made it necessary to run towards something, even if there is nothing to run at. It’s always a belief that one’s life has to be moving and just sitting stationary is a sin.People without a drive to go anywhere are generally looked down upon and labelled inefficient, incompetent, and lazy. One cannot be still in this fast-paced world.
Title: Being, Not Doing Content: Zen teachings tell us that we are perfect as we are, where we are. Life is perfect as it is, and there is no need to rush anywhere to find happiness. People have this misconception that getting a better job, making more money, buying new fancy toys, will provide them with happiness, because true happiness can be attained right now, at this very moment. 
Title: Get Off The Hamster Wheel Content: Once we stop striving to get somewhere else, only then we get off the rat race, the hamster wheel of life thrust upon us by society, and find peace in this very moment, as this is all that we have.Just being in this perfect moment, understanding that there is nowhere to go, and immersing yourself in love and gratitude is the key to happiness.
