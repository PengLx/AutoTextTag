Title: DISH and DirecTV Content: Dish used an ad campaign to compare the prices of Dish (which was much better priced) with DirectTV and cable TV.Direct TV countered with a lawsuit, and said that Dish's claims were false as there were differences in package offers. They ran their own series of ads to debunk various Dish advertising claims.
