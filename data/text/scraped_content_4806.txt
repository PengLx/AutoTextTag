Title: Time Management For Leaders Content: Managing time gets challenging as our career progresses and we take up more responsibilities.Five ways we can manage our time like a successful leader:Plan realistic reactive time.Don't respond habitually.Avoid the 25-minute meeting rule.Carve out your best 'brain time'.Answer a 'Yes' with true Intent.
Title: Plan The Unexpected Important Stuff Content: About 40% to 60% of our day is taken up by important stuff that needs our attention but is not on our daily calendar.Planning our day accordingly, keeping about half of it free for these 'out-of-calendar' activities, is realistic and sustainable.
Title: Ask For Time Content: Instead of committing to getting the requested assignment done as soon as possible, factor in some buffer time and ask for a couple of days or a week.This will help you get the work done along with any 'reactive realities' that come up, and it's a win-win if you get it done before the deadline.
Title: Dynamic Meetings Content: Rather than having habitual meetings, make them dynamic and result-oriented.Focus on the problem, and ensure there is a continuous follow-up, giving people space to brainstorm and come up with solutions.
Title: Your Best 'Brain Time' Content: You need to figure out when your brain works best and get heavy work done in those productive hours.These windows of 'brain time' cannot be wasted with meetings and chores that end up wasting your time.
Title: The Value of Time Content: We normally get frustrated and can have a frowning expression when we are interrupted while being busy. When saying a 'no' can be impolite, a better way is to say 'yes' and then asking respectfully to fix a time to discuss.The best leaders know the value of time and are proactive and purposeful in handling their daily calendar.
