Title: Bad advice Content: Advice that promises a shortcut or a universal truth is usually bad advice.
Title: One right way to do things Content: When someone prescribes a specific formula or time limit for an activity, be skeptical.Whether it’s exercise, meditation, or other routines, don’t let all-or-nothing thinking deprive you of the benefits of doing something—even for a little while.
Title: Being around positive people Content: Stop seeking out only positive people and those with similar mindsets. People with a more pessimistic style may teach you lessons about how you want to view the world. They may also be able to see pitfalls and concerns that those with more rose-colored glasses don’t readily see.
Title: Using 'hacks' Content: Making changes to your life is hard work. There are no shortcuts.You can’t just do one simple thing and have your life fall into place.
Title: Trusting the process Content: Just following a process isn’t enough.If you don’t know your goal and what it’s going to take to get there, no amount of focus on the process is going to be enough.You need context, measurement, and engagement to truly move the needle on your personal growth and effectiveness.
