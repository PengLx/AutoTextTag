Title: First-Hand Knowledge Content: Instead of following preset beliefs (good or bad), Friedrich Nietzsche, the famous German philosopher, took the hard role of a life archaeologist, with an attempt to uncover the base truths that govern our actions and belief patterns. History, and its momentum, he said, is the reason we are forever carried forward.
Title: Living The Same Life Content: Imagining a life where things keep getting repeated sounds unbearable. However, Nietzsche takes it a challenge.His worldview is that things have to be dealt with in a way that you would if they kept on happening again and again.  If we are to do the same thing for eternity, it might as well be the right thing.
