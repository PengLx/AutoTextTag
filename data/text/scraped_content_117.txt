Title: Psychological flexibility Content: Being open to emotional experiences and being able to tolerate discomfort can allow us to move towards a more meaningful existence. The way we respond to the circumstances of our lives has more influence on our happiness than the events themselves.
Title: True happiness Content: It isnâ€™t about being happy all the time. Striving for a happy life is one thing, but striving to be happy all the time is unrealistic.
Title: The 2 philosophical paths to happiness Content: Hedonistic: in order to live a happy life we must maximize pleasure and avoid pain. This view is often short-lived.  Eudaimonic approach: it takes the long view and argues that we should live authentically and for the greater good. We should pursue meaning and potential through kindness, justice, honesty, and courage.
Title: Happiness and adversity Content: Leading a happy life is not about avoiding hard times. A happy life is about being able to respond to adversity in a way that allows you to grow from the experience. And experiencing adversity can make us more resilient and lead us to take action in our lives, such as changing jobs or overcoming hardship.
