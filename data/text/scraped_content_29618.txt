Title: Pushing yourself too hard Content: Pushing your body to reach new levels of fitness requires commitment and effort that are intense and challenging.But without the right balance of rest and recovery you could end up with a long-term fatigue condition called overtraining syndrome.
Title: Overtraining symptoms Content: Common symptoms include:Long-term decrease in sports performanceLess motivation to exerciseLow moodMuscle soreness, aches and painsLoss of good quality sleepGeneral tiredness or fatigueSymptoms can vary wildly from person to person. Other life stresses, such as working long hours, difficult relationships, dieting, and not getting enough sleep, can accelerate the syndrome.The only reliable method to assess if you have overtraining syndrome is to track how long it takes you to recover. If you bounce back after a week or two, you probably weren't overtraining.
Title: Overreaching and best training recovery tools Content: Overreaching is a similar condition to overtraining and it is also characterized by performance decline, but recovery takes several days to weeks. Hard and frequent training, coupled with poor sleep, high levels of stress, and low calorie, low-carb diet may all make someone more likely to develop overtraining syndrome. The best recovery tool is to manage your training.Take a break from demanding exercise and let your body heal and repair itself. Do light activities, such as walking or stretching.Ensure you're eating healthilyAim for a sufficient amount of undisturbed sleep each night.
