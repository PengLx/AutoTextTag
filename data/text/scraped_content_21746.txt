Title: A sense of 'enough' Content: Enough is defined as 'as much as is necessary or to the degree needed.' But what's necessary or needed is often exchanged for what will bring us short-lived satisfaction: we focus on how we'll achieve our next milestone or seek bigger living spaces.As we continually extend the bounds of enough, we might lose sight of what really matters: the roof over our head, the clothes on our body, a reliable means for transportation, a clean bill of health, the food on our table.
Title: Hedonic adaptation Content: Hedonic adaptation refers to our desire to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness after a positive or negative change. When we get a promotion or buy a new television, we may be happy for a while but will gradually grow accustomed to the choice and privilege they afford.
Title: Our understanding of 'enough' Content: Rather than seeking long-term happiness, fulfilment, success, and acknowledgment, we can reframe our understanding of enough.What do I need to do to keep my body healthy?What do I need to eat to ensure I donâ€™t go hungry?Where do I need to cut back so I can pay my bills, reduce my debt, save for something enjoyable?What relationships are most important to me, and how can I help them grow?Where in my home do I feel most energized and relaxed? How does my present job enable me to find a greater sense of meaning or purpose?Which of my belongings or hobbies detracts from my understanding that what I have is enough?
Title: Nothing external will make our lives complete Content: Our value is not determined by what we do or what we own. Honour the qualities within yourself. This allows you to find enrichment amid difficulty and encourages you to make the most of what you're given.
