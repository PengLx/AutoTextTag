Title: Midlife Crisis Content: We are biologically programmed to have some sort of mental crisis in the age group of 45 to 55 (the midlife).Just as bodily changes occur during puberty and the teen years, the mind undergoes developmental stages of adjustments, with functions switching on and then switching off at a later stage of life.
Title: The Young And The Restless Content: The teen years are a time when refinements in synapses and the brain wiring are happening, along with various biological changes due to the highly conspicuous social and psychological transformation. The brain is on overdrive due to a high level of diverse engagements like:Romantic relationships.Intimate bondings.Independence from the family.Exploring a career path.
Title: Stressful Life Changes Content: Any illness, physical or mental can be compounded by psychological stress and anxiety. Adolescence to adulthood comprises a tsunami of psychological changes.These psychological and biological changes are in fact programmed developments of the body that may be parallel or corresponding to the changes that occur during midlife.
Title: Humans Have An Expiration Date Content: The adolescence principles seem to apply at our later stages of life, when we begin to lose neurons and synapses, reducing our ability to learn or grasp new information.The biological transformations of the young and the elderly are like two sides of the same coin, and there is a complex interplay and connectedness between these two sides, which can lead to mental health issues.
Title: Peak, Plateau and Downslide Content: The decreasing body functions and â€˜wear and tear in men who are in the plateau of midlife, is a normal occurrence and is experienced by everyone in varying degrees. The biological clocks inside us are keeping time for the onset of decline.Simply put, midlife crisis is real and common.
