Title: Humor during a crisis Content: For ancient Greek philosophers, humor was something that had the potential to undermine authority and the good order.Today, in democratic societies, those in power are mocked and their power undermined, as in Saturday Night Live in the United States, and Have I Got News for You in Britain.
Title: The power of laughter Content: Humor, in a way, protects us from life's grim reality. We joke because if we didn't, we'd cry.Humor and laughing are also a social vocalization that includes some and excludes others. Jokes establish who is inside the group and who is not.  We laugh with people to belong, and at others to exclude.In our current crises, humor is everywhere because fear is too. Laughter binds us together against a common enemy.
Title: When to joke Content: Poking fun at the ills of the world is only funny if they are considered benign. No one is making memes about child abuse that may increase during periods of enforced domestic isolation.Observations about people's behavior can be funny if they poke fun at a social norm in a relatively inoffensive way, such as hoarding toilet paper.
