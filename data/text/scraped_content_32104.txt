Title: How humans communicate with each other Content: Humans communicate with sound. It is what permits one brain to talk to another - through words.However humans can also communicate through a wide variety of modality such as:face and voice signalsspeechbraillefacial and body language; andvocal tones
Title: The existence of language Content: The existence of language mainly revolves around the evolution of oral and written communication by humans. Linguists understand that language is a composition of words and rules of compositions.
Title: Physical spaces where language occurs Content: Internal - it consists of electrical waves that are the channels for neuronal communication processes.External - it consists of mechanical, acoustic waves of compressed rarefied molecules of air - i.e. sound.
Title: Sound emission decoding Content: Physical signal is emitted when one brain talks to another. There is not a single signal that gets lost between exchanges.The interesting factor in recent studies is that the electrical waves of the internal physical spaces maintain the architecture of their corresponding sound waves in the non-auditory places of the brain that is responsible for speech formulation.
Title: A surprising discovery in the sound emission decoding experiment Content: The experiment for the not-so-novel study of sound emission decoding involved sixteen patients to read linguistic expressions aloud.The most remarkable information taken during the experiment was that when the patients read the linguistic expressions without emitting a single noise, the signal that entered the brain was not a sound wave but instead a light signal which conserved the architecture as that of a mechanical sound wave corresponding to words that had actually been uttered.
Title: The possibility of decoding the root of human language Content: The two known codes – sound waves and electric waves brought about by sound – could be taken advantage of to explore the third one – the electric code generated in the absence of sound – wherein could eventually guide us to a more fruitful understanding of the human languages’ core.
