Title: Misophonia Content: Misophonia is characterized by strong negative emotions such as anger and anxiety in response to everyday sounds other people make. These sounds include humming, chewing, typing, and even breathing.People with this disorder are not just getting annoyed at the sounds. They suffer breakdowns in relationships or even quitting their jobs.
Title: Misophonia and brain particularities Content: Scientists do not fully understand misophonia but suspect it's caused by the way some people's brains process particular sounds and react to them.Some studies found that the brains of people with misophonia showed hyperactivation of the salience network, a group of brain areas that direct our attention to important things in our surroundings. Trigger sounds send the salience network into an overdrive. Researchers found these brain areas are structurally more robust in people with misophonia.
Title: Calming a misophonic brain Content: There's a lot of similarity between people who experience misophonia, but also a lot of diversity. Therapists use a variety of techniques that is often based on the symptoms. Those who experience fear and anxiety may respond to exposure-based treatments. Those who experience anger can learn to manage their distress through distraction or relaxation techniques.
