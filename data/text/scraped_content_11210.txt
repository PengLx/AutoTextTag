Title: Fromüíîto‚ù§Ô∏è Content: To start this, give yourself permission to love yourself. You are worthy of being loved, even if you tell yourself you‚Äôre not. Take a moment to tell yourself this and permit yourself to love yourself.This is the first step in accepting that you can love yourself and that you are choosing it.You are who you are, and there is nothing wrong with that.You are going to fail a lot in your life, so you might as well have it on your side and when you do. It will grow and foster self-love.The thing about life is that it isn‚Äôt all about you.We are bombarded with negativity, and most of the time, we find ways to be offended as well, even unconsciously. This is biology at work, but now it‚Äôs time to let go of this defense mechanism.To stop taking things very personally:By not taking things personally, you stop torturing yourself and therefore, you love yourself more.Not every negative thing is about you. The world is bigger than just you.If you want to learn how to love yourself, the most important thing you have to do is commit to learning all about it.Like life, you will grow and change by continuously learning new ways to love yourself and express who you really are, and you will be happy.Call your friends and invite them for dinner or just any kind of activities. You need their support and you need a lot of laughters!Take up some new hobbies or just take back up your old hobbies, just anything you enjoy doing!Take a break and go traveling (or a staycation in somewhere you‚Äôve never been to) alone. You need some alone time to quiet your mind.Make some new friends. If you‚Äôre too shy to join your friends‚Äô house parties, take some interest classes and meet people with like-minded. Meeting new people can stimulate your brain and make you happier.
