Title: Passion Content: Passion is not something you discover.Passions tend to be developed. It’s not just about being intense about what you’re doing but waking up week after week, month after month, year after year, wanting to think about the same thing.
Title: Clear out the distractions Content: One reason you may not know your passion: you haven’t given yourself the time and space to pursue it.Reflect on how you’re using your time, and whether or not you want to be distracted by these temptations.
Title: Think of a passion as like an internship Content: Most internships serve as a trial run for a job — while you’re acquiring skills and knowledge, you’re also trying to see if you want to commit.Just like an internship, a passion is something you learn by doing. It takes experience; it takes trial and error.
Title: Be patient Content: During the learning period, you’ll need to tap into the other aspect of grit: persistence.Make sure you give yourself a real chance before you move on to another activity.
Title: Remember the bigger picture Content: Every passion has its share of less exciting moments. For playing the viola, it may be practicing scales for the umpteenth time. For baking, it could be washing up.The secret to not letting them derail you is to see how every way you engage with your passion — no matter how small or dull — is a step toward something bigger.
Title: Avoid burnout Content: It is possible to go overboard while pursuing a passion. Ask yourself if you’re really burning out on your passion or if you just need more sleep.When you’re exhausted, you should use your energy to help another person. It can boost your confidence and give you the sense that progress is possible.
