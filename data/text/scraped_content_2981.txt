Title: Fewer options and decision making  Content: We assume more options will make us happier, but that's not true.By strategically decreasing the number of decisions we need to make we're making sure we actually choose something, and we can save our decisiveness for when it really counts.
Title: Rules Content: A rule is a predetermined response to a given situation,a set action for how you’ll handle a common situation so that you don’t waste any time trying to decide between two or more small and unimportant options.Examples: "I Never answer calls from unrecognized numbers" or "I don’t check email before 10 am, after 7 pm, or on Saturday."

The simplest type of system is a bunch of rules strung together into a chain of good decisions, where each on mandates the next.For example:Put your workout clothes out at night so that when you wake up you immediately put them on and go running.
