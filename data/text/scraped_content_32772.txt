Title: Déjà vu: The Glitch In The Matrix Content: Most people have experienced a sensation where while being in a situation, event, or place, we feel as if we have already experienced the same. This sensation is called déjà vu, meaning ‘already seen’ in french.Some say these are false memories or a  past-life remembrance. Others state that it is a short circuit in our brain or some activity in the ‘rhinal cortex’ of the brain.
Title: Scientists Examine Déjà vu Content: Scientists have studied this phenomenon in the lab using hypnosis and virtual reality, concluding it to be related to memory, where we experience a feeling of familiarity as the new experience seems to be traced according to an old memory.A new study using MRI scans suggested that déjà vu is related to decision making, and the brain may be trying to resolve a conflict in the memory index.
