Title: “I might need it some day” Content: One thing that stops many of us in the process of decluttering is the worry that if we sell, trash, or donate an item (we rarely/ never use), we may need it someday.
Title: When you get rid of something... Content: ... all that happens is that you'll have to buy or borrow the item, if you ever wanted/needed it. That's it.There might be some costs to that, but the costs of keeping that item exist too: it might cost you toroot through to find what you need,stress and guilt when you see it sitting there doing nothing and also useful storage space.
Title: Ask the right question Content: Instead of asking yourself, “Will I need this some day?” consider the alternative question: “Is this stuff affecting the organized life I want?” If the answer — the honest answer — is yes, it’s time to let it go.
