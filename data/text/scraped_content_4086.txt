Title: Hardwired for Stories Content: We love to tell and listen to stories.The 'Story Narrative' is hardwired in us, as we think and remember in stories.A strong narrative can be the difference between success and failure.
Title: Creative Problem Solving Content: Human beings are able to creatively solve problems, alone or in a group. This has given rise to many inventions, shaping common goals shared by a group of people.We needed a 'sticky' idea to spread it among people, and the story narrative is exactly that.
Title: Relating To The Characters Content: Stories cater to our Ego. A listener puts himself in the shoes of the protagonist of a story, and an idea is given emotional heft and sturdiness.The more we are able to relate to the central character, the more engaging, effective and memorable a story narrative becomes.
Title: Story Structure Content: We respond most powerfully to stories that follow a particular setup, or structure:In this setup, the main character has a clear goal, backed by a clear motive. There are obstacles and blockages.There is a struggle, there are other characters added to the mix, and there are certain resources that are made available.The obstacle is overcome in the end and there is a certain growth that has happened, leading to further obstacles or bigger goals.
