Title: Putting your knowledge and skills in perspective Content: When you're feeling notably uncertain about a something, take the time perform an audit, in the objective terms possible.Ask yourself: What is my knowledge base, and what are my previously demonstrated skills? The former might be lacking, but the latter often equips me to learn quickly.
Title: Playing the part Content: Competency requires practice. It doesn't get easier overnight.Playing the part doesn't mean to just fake it, even if there are some benefits to that, too. Instead, by diving in and doing the work even if you don’t feel 100% prepared, your skillset will start to improve as you get more practice.
Title: Clarifying questions in uncertain situations Content: When you’re really unsure, asking questions may be last thing you'd want to do, because it could feel like turning on a spotlight when all you want to do is go unnoticed. But masking uncertainty tends to amplify it.In many situations, questions are an important tool: the more comfortable you get asking for clarification or help, the smoother the path is down the road.
Title: Doubt as a strategy Content: In the right amounts, self-doubt can lead to self-improvement. For this to happen, you need to be able to identify your weak points without  spiraling into despair.Progress starts by zeroing in on areas you need to strengthen and seeking out the relevant information you need to improve.
