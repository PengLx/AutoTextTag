Title: Be Emotionally Strong Content: In leadership, there are times when you need to be mentally tough to navigate through complex information.1.Focus on the moment. The challenges that come along from time to time are a test of our willingness to stretch and change. The worst thing you can do is to ignore the situation or procrastinate in developing solutions. The challenge is here and the difficulty is now. Focus your energy on the present moment; don't lose what is right before you. When you focus on the moment you come to realize where you have the most power to make things right.2.Embrace adversity. Mental strength gives us the ability to see the obstacles in our path as stepping stones. When we encounter struggle, and we all do, we can be inspired by the knowledge that it's not a dead end but a path to deeper knowledge and understanding.
