Title: Flexibility Exercises Aren't Enough Content: Just being flexible isn't providing us with the necessary level of fitness, and the role of stretching exercises prescribed at the gym is now being debated.Being flexible isn't making us age better, or be injury-free and is not improving our sports performance in any activity which does not require a wide range of motion.
Title: Go For Strength Training Content: Strength Training is a better alternative to stretching, and the pro-athletes are now skipping the stretching part of the pre-workout routine and replacing it with a 3-stage dynamic workout:Start with a simple jog or swim to warm up.Progress towards dynamic stretching that moves your muscle and uses the full range of motion.Do relaxed 15-second short workout bursts to ease yourself towards your main workout.
Title: Static Flexibility Content: This is exemplified by the sit-and-reach test, in which you see how close you can come to touching your toes (or how far beyond them you can reach) while sitting on the floor with legs outstretched.The best way to improve static flexibility is with static stretching, which involves pushing to the edge of your range of motion and holding a position for 20- 30 seconds.
