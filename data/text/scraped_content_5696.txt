Title: No More Gym Visits Content: As the novel virus spreads across the world, most people are at home in a lockdown. Personal trainers recommend a few ways to work out from the comfort of your home, without any high-tech equipment.
Title: Home Work Outs Content: Burpees are a quick push-up and jump combination that can be done easily on a flat surface. Itâ€™s a good idea to start with five to ten of them, and then challenge yourself with 100 in one go.Air squats are an effective basic lower body exercise that can be done anywhere and combined with push-ups, mountain climbers and lunges, become a full body work out.
Title: Work Out Creativity Content: Simple movements can be made challenging and more effective by holding them at key positions(like the bottom movement of a squat), making the muscles work harder. Any exercise that gets your heart pumping and makes you uses oxygen as fuel for the muscles is a cardio exercise.Home furniture, like a chair, can be used to support your squats and also your upper body during tricep dips. For weights, broomsticks or jugs full of water can be used.Keep washing your hands, eating healthy, and hydrating yourself, while getting plenty of sleep.
