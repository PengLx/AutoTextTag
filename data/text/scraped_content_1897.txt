Title: Your purpose in life Content: ... has very little to do with your job. Your purpose is to unlock and fold in who you are becoming with who you already are. The activities that force you to grow are your calling. Learning from those activities is your purpose.Your life purpose is way too big to be filled by one role, or even one long career. If you choose wisely, your job can point you toward your purpose.
