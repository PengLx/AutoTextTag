Title: Ice Baths For Athletes Content: Many athletes and sportspersons have an ice bathing ritual post their performances or even after routine workouts to recover their muscles, by reducing the temperature, tissue inflammation and blood flow. This is also done to reduce swelling and pain in their limbs.Extreme cold temperatures may work in the short run, and help athletes recover at a faster rate, especially if they are to perform again in the coming days.
Title: Ice Baths And Long Term Muscle Strengthening Content: Ice baths are not recommended for ling term muscle strengthening. New studies show that while the ice bath method works to some extent, it does not help in building muscles, and might even slow down the natural repair process.This method can be used occasionally for a quick recovery but is not recommended if one wants stronger muscles in the long run.
