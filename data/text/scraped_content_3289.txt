Title: Almost anyone can learn to sing Content: If you have a pair of vocal folds that can produce sound and you can you tell the difference between a higher note and a lower note, you and about 98.5% of the population absolutely can be taught how to sing.The rest of about 1.5% of the population suffers from a condition called “congenital amusia”. They have real difficulty discriminating between different pitches, tone, and sometimes rhythm.
Title: Talent and practice Content: Natural talent aside, most of us can be taught to sing.Andit is not just how much you practice that counts, but rather how quickly you identify and correct your error. This is what makes an OK singer into an expert performer. Without deliberate practice, even the most talented singer will reach a plateau and get stuck.
Title: Vocal freedom Content: Singing practice and training involves generating a sense of vocal freedom – this is what you’re seeing when you watch someone sing movingly, beautifully but seemingly without effort.For most singers, years of practice go into developing that kind of freedom.
Title: Physical skill and control Content: Singing looks simple but actually involves highly skilled control and coordination of muscles - and these muscles need to be both flexible and strong. True control comes from training.A person needs to be able to control the air pressure in their lungs and use their abdominal muscles to push air through the trachea, where it meets the vocal folds, which start to vibrate. In a really good singer, vocal health, posture alignment and breath management are matched with imagination, self-expression and creativity.
