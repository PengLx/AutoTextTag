Title: Drinking milk and strong bones Content: The main thought process that we have when drinking milk is that it's going to strengthen our bones because of the calcium.Studies suggest that drinking milk could help bone density but only in the span of two years. Moreover, there is a correlation between drinking milk with higher bone fractures and early deaths.
Title: Why we shouldn't worry about drinking milk Content: There are different researches where the problem or causation and correlation are brought up with drinking milk. The current weight of evidence suggests that it is still OK to continue to drink milk if you like it. It most likely has benefits that attribute to bone health but it may just be short lived rather than what we expected.We can also keep our bones strong by taking in vitamin D - either through the sunlight or supplements - and getting the right amount of exercise.
