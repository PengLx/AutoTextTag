Title: The forms of love Content: Love is not just found in romantic love directed at one person.Love includesthe depth of close friendships, the sense of belonging in a community, the intensity of an artistic practice or a connection to our work.
Title: It takes a village to feel loved Content: In history, marriage was a pragmatic institution. A sense of identity was more embedded in community, and not solely in marriage.The shift to individualism and choice has meant that we feel the need to find our identity in an all-encompassing romantic partnership.We are asking from one person what once an entire village used to provide.Recognising that one person can't be your everything can help you find a broader definition of love.
Title: The love of friendship Content: Sharing your experiences with others is an essential ingredient to feeling connected.This conncectiondoesn't have to come in the form of a partner or having friends around you all the time. Rather, it is the quality of your close relationships that has an impact on your well being.
Title: The feeling of fulfilment Content: Our relationship with ourself is as important as the relationships we build with other people.Our work, our hobbies and interests, our creative projects, our day-to-day experiences can be a source of both love and meaning.The greatest sense of fulfilment is from being stretched in a voluntary effortto accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.
