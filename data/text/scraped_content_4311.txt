Title: Going through a breakup Content: Heartbreak is a form of grief and loss that can cause serious issues with insomnia, anxiety and depression.The pain we feel during heartbreak is similar to the physical pain we feel due to a severe burn on a broken arm.
Title: Healing from a breakup Content: Visual reminders are likely to create dopamine surges in your brain that relate to feelings of craving and withdrawal.Replace those surges of dopamine by taking a fitness class. Exercise can also release endorphins that trigger positive feelings.Find a "new normal". Accept the reason for the breakup.
