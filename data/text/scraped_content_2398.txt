Title: The Fear Of Rejection Content: It interferes with performance and inhibits expression.Taken to its extreme, we become totally preoccupied with not making a mistake, with seeking approval for security above all other considerations.
Title: Define the Problem in Writing Content: Write a clear description of your problem, the answer to the question, “What exactly am I worrying about?”Fully 50% of all problems can be solved at this definition stage. Many of our worries exist because we have not taken the time to sit down and really define clearly what it is that is bothering us.
Title: The Worst Possible Outcome Content: Write out the worst possible outcome of the worry situation. Answer the question, “What is the worst possible thing that can happen as a result of this problem?”It is resistance to facing the worst possible outcome that causes most of the anxiety and stress associated with worry. Writing it down will take away its power.
Title: Accept the Worst Possible Outcome Content: Start telling yourself,"If it happens this way, I’ll learn to live with it."Once you have resolved to accept the worst, should it occur, you no longer have anything to worry about. All the stress caused by denial, by refusing to face what the worst could be, suddenly disappears.
Title: Begin Improving On The Worst Content: Think of everything that you could possibly do to make sure that the very worst does not occur.Once you stop worrying and have resolved to accept the worst, your mind will be calm and clear and capable of creative thought.  By overcoming fear you are now in a position to do something constructive.
