Fashion & Beauty,Philosophy
Title: Beauty Content: Popular phrases define beauty as 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder,' or 'beauty is only skin deep.' But the question is: Should we define beauty by what we see in the media or by popular culture and trends?We often do not have a clear view of what beauty is. We use different life experiences and memories we have and blend them to form our own definition of our beauty.
Title: Misguided definition of beauty Content: Our definition of beauty is often formed in three ways:As young children, our opinion of beauty is based on what was said about us from our parents and those around us.In adolescence, we are more acutely aware of our appearance and may lead us to question how we look.Socially constructed ideas of beauty we see in the media, popular culture, society, peers, and social media can create a false ideal of beauty.
Title: Real beauty Content: Real beauty is acceptance of yourself, including your perceived flaws. It's having character, kindness, strength, and self-confidence.You are a masterpiece - a work of art. There is only one you made up of your unique genes and life experiences. Beauty is about starting to appreciate yourself as you would any other piece of art.
