It is a feeling that the situation(or surrounding) is familiar subjectively, but unfamiliar objectively.Almost two-thirds of individuals have experienced Déjà vu at least once in their lifetime, including blind people.Déjà vu is a fleeting, intangible experience, making it hard to measure, and is also highly subjective.
Title: Our Memory Content: Déjà vu can be explained in terms of our memory:Single Event Familiarity: When one element is familiar but other elements are not.Example: When you see a person you vaguely recognize(like your barber) out in the street.Gestalt Familiarity: When the layout and surroundings seem familiar.Example: A layout of a room is similar to a room you have seen before but some details are not matching.
Title: Our Neurology Content: Déjà vu can be explained in terms of our neurological activity:Spontaneous Brain Activity: When a part of your brain is engaged with memory, thoughts can overlap, and one can experience a false sense of familiarity. The complex memory structures result in cross-connections.Neural transmission speed:  Déjà vu can be felt when the various parts of one’s brain that transmit information get disrupted, or if the information arrives at different times, like a traffic jam in the brain’s highways.
