It's the things you have to do, but don't want to do.You can change this, but you need an inspiring goal to get you started. If your project doesn't excite you, no advice will help.
Title: Problems of anxiety when learning something Content: Sometimes you are excited to learn, but you still avoid getting started. You may worry about the fear of failure, feedback, or performing.
