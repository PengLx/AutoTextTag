Title: Fear Content: Fear is a universal experience. It is not a dreadful thing to feel fear when faced with the unknown. It's part of being alive.We should become intimate with fear instead of treating it as a problem to be solved. Out of that arises strength.
Title: Life is a good teacher Content: Things are always in transition. To stay with the uncertainty is the path of true awakening - relaxing in the midst of chaos, learning not to panic.
Title: Mastering Maitri Content: Remaining present and intimate with the moment requires "maitri" - the Buddhist practice of loving-kindness toward oneself.With "maitri", you're not trying to solve a problem or making the pain go away or becoming a better person. It is giving up control altogether and letting concepts and ideals fall apart. Thoughts and emotions come and go, but basic nowness is always here.
Title: Ye tang che Content: The Tibetan expressions "ye tang che", is another Buddhist concept at odds with our Western coping mechanism. "Ye tang che" means totally tired out. It describes the feeling of complete hopelessness and is the beginning of the beginning. Without giving up hope - that there's something better  - we will never relax with where we are or who we are.
