Title: Studying better Content: When it comes to studies, most of us tend to get really  stressed. Which is basically normal, as it is about evaluating our own knowledge in the different fields. However, there are some tips that can help you pass the exams without freaking out. For instance, going through the books properly: checking out the glossary, index, study questions, can really prove helpful when starting to learn for a subject.
Title: Make use of sticky notes Content: Using sticky notes is extremely useful when studying for an exam: not only do you summarize the information, but you can also go directly to the needed page, as the note is stuck to that very page. 
Title: Using graph organizers Content: Graph organizers are forms that you can fill out with important information. When starting to actually learn for a test, you just have to go again through this information. Furthermore, graph organizers such as Cornell notes worksheet enable you to check your knowledge at any given moments through different quizzes. 
Title: Evaluate yourself Content: After having finished to study, make up your own practice test, which is supposed to evaluate your knowledge on that given topic. If you are unsatisfied with the result, just go back to study some more.
Title: Use flashcards Content: Flashcards are always a good idea! Try making flashcards before taking an actual test: on the front of the card write down a term or a question and on the back of it the definition or the answer. You are most certainly going to go back to this studying method, as it has proven its efficiency so many times before.
