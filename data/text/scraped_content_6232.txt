Title: Writing letters as therapy Content: Unlike modern communication tools like text messages, letters have a unique, personal and intimate identity. Letter writing is a lost art, and an important tool for therapy. The pent up feelings inside us, the right and wrong impressions, conceptions (and misconceptions), explanations, and apologies that are left unsaid, can be expressed in a letter to anyone we want, even ourselves.Itâ€™s not important that we actually send the letter to the person, however, the letters that really need to be sent, are also the most therapeutic.
Title: Letters Of Courage Content: Letters that are just for us provide us with a space for reflection where we have a conversation with our identity, our inner-critic, or our ego. Secret, unsent letters that we write to others, are a one-way communication where we express our inner feelings, desires and emotions in the truest sense, to someone who will never read it. Letter of closure, where we are communicating with the person for the last time, becomes a relic, a lifelong reminder of the realness of our experiences.
