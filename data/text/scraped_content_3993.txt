Title: Our own reality Content: Everyone has their own reality. The concept of a “personal brand” is to let others know who you are because if you don't, others will.But, the reality is that although you can guide people, you can't fully manage how they'll perceive you. Everyone has their own reality and their own interpretation of the facts, their environment, and other people.
Title: We see what we look for Content: We tend to assume that our perceptions of sights, sounds, textures, and tastes are an accurate portrayal of the real world.But when we find ourselves fooled by a perceptual illusion, we realize that what we perceive, is our brain's best guess at what that world is like.
Title: Different perceptions Content: No-one will ever view us as we view ourselves.We should consider if we are entitled to be seen by others the way we see ourselves.
Title: How others see us Content: We do not get to choose what others see. How they see other people is their reality. In relationships, our partner might even think they "love" "us", when in fact the "us" they love is different than the "us " we see in ourselves.
Title: Finding common ground Content: Although we cannot dictate people's reality, we can choose to surround ourselves with people who see things similarly.You can choose a partner who does see you as a complete "someone" and values you as much as they value themselves.
