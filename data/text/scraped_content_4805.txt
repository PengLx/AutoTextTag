Title: Being Interesting Is An Art Content: It isn't about being perfect, articulate, or factual (which can be a put off), but about opening a channel of communication so that the other person wants to understand what you have to say.Being interesting has many advantages, as you do generally well in any social interaction like a date, a job interview, or a family dinner.
Title: Be Interested Content: Being excited, enthusiastic and interested in what you have to say rubs off on others. Even if your core topic is dull, you can connect it with something interesting.
Title: Ignite The Dialogue Content: Rambling, ranting and lecturing only makes others wish the conversation was over yesterday.Listen, and spark some real dialogue and conversation by making others participate, being genuinely interested in what they are saying.
Title: The Power Of A Story Content: Stories make us listen. Storytellers are interesting by default. A personal story is a military-grade technique to connect with others provided it's genuine, heartfelt and interesting. 
Title: Laughing Together Content: Laughing together is a beautiful way of connecting, and helps people remember what is being discussed. Self-deprecating laughter, or laughing at things that are absurd and unexpected, wrong or right is a sign of a healthy, stimulating conversation, and people will have no choice but to be interested in you.
