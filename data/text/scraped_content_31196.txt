Title: You are unique Content: -This document is based on how uniquely you are created and how you are different from other individuals-If you think you are totally weird comparing to other person...stop thinking and make a change.-This document will enlightened your mood and make a small change in mind and think differently-AuthorIn every individual there is something unique in everything.If you are willing to know what are your desire and strength, then you will get your answerAll your strengths,passion,sucess is inside of you...your will power is the only strength that no one can defeat youOut of all these hardwork that you put,you find lots of criticism,but just face it...and if you think you can do it,then you can do it..it's all in your mind...it's a mind game.If there is a unique thing that you think you can do it then you are winner and no one is great as you.Do whatever you want to do in life but keep ur aim at the farthest and there you should see you are the unique of being yourself.What is unique?->Being the only one of it's Kind>Very specialOr i should say in my perspective....Being unique means being yourself,being true to yourself or an attitude which is of two kinds:-good and bad attitudeA way of thinking and self confident,In what way do you think of a thing or a person whether you think in good or bad way.It's your choice but when you have a good attitude,the way of thinking is totally different from other perspective like those who have negative vibes.When you have an attitude of goodness, you built a strong self confident of who you are....Being the only one of its kinds means you are created uniquely,you have different minset to create something new or produce a good effect or have good productivity....No one everthink the same, so you will face many criticism among your friends,even with your families or siblings.And it is natural because you are unique....For example your dad and your perspective/the way you think and say/ideas or logic...you don't accept it all...sometimes you critize them or remain silent because the logic he carries in his head are from his pastime or the way he thinks and your thoughts and the things you see today or logic in your mind are totally different from each other.The generation differentiate so does the logic and i often hear or see people saying im worthless,useless,im not beautiful/handsome.Some people takes it as an insult manner when somebody says you are beautiful...but you should know that every person have different way of liking a person,there will be some person who will like you and who does not like you and there is saying, "if all the people like you, then you have a problem."If a person does not like you that does not mean,he/she hate completely about you...but from his/her thoughts are different from you or othersYou often hear people say like that actress is beautiful but others one will say no, she is better than that actress, just like that people have different mind setAnd the most important thing that i want share with is that why do we feel so dumb about ourself?The reason is that we have sense of comparing to someone else who you think they are more beautiful/more talented/more good in studies etcBut let me say this to you that the day you stop comparing to someone else will the day that you start loving yourself more.Being compare often makes you a room full of insecurities and it will make you fill with thoughts full of logic which is not real at all.You just have to say yourself that im unique,im beautifully created and i will move on to make it good one in life.All the things you see like actress,singers,sports person are unique...they don't care about what they look...they just improve on what they are good at it and improve it day by day.Just don't be an emotional fool, stand up for a little change...this little changes day by day will make a big change someday and when you do it and look back and say what a change i have make.But you don't have to stop,keep running on own unique things you do...and be original and unique..that the power of being you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
