Title: Social media Content: The rise of social media has meant that we as a global population are more connected than we have ever been in the history of time.However, our reliance on social media can have a detrimental effect on our mental health.
Title: Self-esteem Content: A study conducted by the University of Copenhagen found that many people suffer from “Facebook envy”, with those who abstained from using the popular site reporting that they felt more satisfied with their lives.Becoming more conscious of the amount of time you spend scrolling through other people’s online profiles could help you focus more on yourself and boost your self-confidence.
Title: Human connection Content: It’s so important for us to be able to communicate and forge personal connections with one another. However, it can be hard to do so when we’re glued to rectangular screens, becoming more acquainted with our friends’ digital facades than their real-life personas.A study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology that assessed 5,208 subjects found that overall, regular use of Facebook had a negative impact on an individual’s wellbeing.
Title: Memory Content: Social media can be great for looking back fondly on memories and recounting how past events occurred.However, it can also distort the way in which you remember certain tidbits from your life.We are guilty of spending far too much time trying to take the perfect photo of a visual marvel, all the while not actually absorbing the firsthand experience of witnessing it with our own two eyes.

Title: Attention span Content: While it’s incredible to consider the amount of information readily available at our fingertips thanks to social media, it also means that people have become far more easily distracted.If you’re unable to not check your phone for at least a few minutes, then you’d do well to practise exercising your willpower on occasion.
Title: Mental health Content: In March 2018, it was reported that more than a third of Generation Z from a survey of 1,000 individuals stated that they were quitting social media for good as 41 per cent stated that social media platforms make them feel anxious, sad or depressed.
