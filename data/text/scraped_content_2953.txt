Title: Set multiple deadlines Content: A way to create less stressful deadlines is to break large projects into smaller tasks. Set a deadline for each task instead of just one final deadline.Regularly spacing the deadlines out will give a sense of moving forward, which can motivate you to complete the task.
Title: Yerkes-Dodson law Content: The Yerkes-Dodson law states that the more mental arousal there is in doing a task, the more efficient a person becomes. After you get to a certain threshold, your performance begins to decrease.An appropriate quantity of stress should inspire increased productivity.
Title: Your ideal stress level Content: Difficult tasks require low levels of stress, while easy tasks require high levels of stress to trigger mental arousal.The next time you set a deadline, try placing a rush deadline for easier tasks and set your deadline far out for more difficult projects.
Title: Set more urgent deadlines Content: If you lack motivation and don't manage to meet your deadlines, try to set a more pressing deadline for yourself. This will give you a sense of urgency to complete the task.
Title: Share your goals and progress Content: While we recognize our own procrastination and try to curb it via self-imposed deadlines, these aren't always as effective as deadlines set for them by others.If you don't have a boss or project sponsor who's setting deadlines for you, it might be worth asking someone to become your accountability partner.
Title: Turn deadlines into a game Content: It is naturally harder for us to concentrate on a task or measure progress on a project when we're bored.To overcome this, turn the task into a game and include rewards, to make it more fun and motivating.
