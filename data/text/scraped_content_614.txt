Title: Simplicity doesn't mean poverty Content:  Poverty is involuntary and debilitating, whereas simplicity is voluntary and enabling.It is very misleading to equate simplicity with poverty, even if some spiritual traditions have advocated a life of extreme renunciation. A life of conscious simplicity can have both a beauty and a functional integrity that elevates the human spirit.
Title: Simplicity doesn't mean rural living Content: Adopting a simple life doesn't require moving into rural areas. In fact, themajority of persons choosing a life of conscious simplicity live in cities and suburbs.It is much more accurate to describe this as a "make the most of wherever you are" movement, adapting ourselves creatively to a rapidly changing world in the context of big cities and suburbs.
Title: Beauty in the simple life Content: The simple life is sometimes viewed as an approach to living that advocates a barren plainness and denies the value of beauty and aesthetics. But rather than a denial of beauty, simplicity liberates the aesthetic sense by freeing things from artificial burdens.
