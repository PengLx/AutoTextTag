Title: Money Heist Content: Money Heist is a thriller where the gang -all code-named after major cities - break into the Royal Mint of Spain, taking 67 people hostage and actively printing money. The plot doesn't go quite as planned and results in three romances and an island escape.
Title: A different scale Content: Money Heist is part of a wave of Spanish dramas that have commanded large international audiences in recent years. Money Heist is the single most-watched series in countries including France, Italy, Argentina, and Brazil; 34 million households watched the third series in its first week alone.
Title: The main selling point Content: Cultural specificity is one of the show's main selling points. Feeling, fraternity and love are as important as the plots. In contrast, the English 'perfect heist' genre is cooler, more restrained, and more scientific.
Title: The political edge Content: Although the series is meant to entertain, there is a political edge to the series' "anti-system."  The action genre used to be considered shallow and superficial, but here skepticism towards governments, central banks, and the system are combined with an entertaining narrative.
