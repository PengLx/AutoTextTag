Title: Being Fully Present Content: In this age of optimization, we are compelled to do more, to multitask and provide quick results.The key to happiness is to be fully present in whatever you are doing.
Title: Being Flawed Content: Being vulnerable and flawed is a virtue, not something to look down upon.Social media is full of people showing off their perfect lives, and we fall victim to this constant pressure of being invincible and perfect.
