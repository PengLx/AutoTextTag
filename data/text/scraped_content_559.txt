Title: Light levels Content: Natural light provides our bodies with vitamin D, which in turn promotes healthy bone growth, and has been found to actively contribute to our physical and cognitive productivity. Put simply, if the indoor environments we spend time in are poorly naturally lit, our productivity can suffer – particularly in the winter, when the daylight hours are shorter.
