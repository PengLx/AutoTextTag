Title: Self - love  Content: Positive self-talk needs to be practiced every day. Try to start your day off by writing down10 positive affirmations or 10 things you love about yourself.Growing up I always loved to spend time enjoying nature, painting, and writing. Now that I am older it’s harder to make time to do those things. But it’s important to make time for the things that bring us joy. So I really recommend you to do more things you love, always take some time every day for that.Eat healthily, get more exercise, drink more water, read a book, go for a walk, practice self-care. Journal! Write your daily thoughts, goals, feelings. If you start following a healthy daily routine, you’ll be amazed at the positive energy that carries with you throughout your day.Try to be mindful of who you spend your time with. Anyone who makes you feel less than enough doesn’t deserve to be part of your life. End all toxic relationships. Simple. Only surround yourself with positive energy.
