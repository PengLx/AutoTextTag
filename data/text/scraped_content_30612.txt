Title: The Daily Breaks We Need Content: In a given day, time is fairly distributed to everyone, but energy is more of our own domain and fluctuates during the day.Better exercise provides us with more energy levels, resulting in better productivity.Taking breaks or doing some varied activity can enhance our energy levels, and there are three kinds of breaks that our mind and body needs to replenish and nourish itself.
Title: Three Kinds Of Breaks Content: Physical Break: Any kind of exercise, including a stroll outside in fresh air, does the trick.Social Break: Grabbing a cup of coffee or any beverage of choice and chatting up with a friend or colleague.Spiritual Break: Praying, meditating, reading spiritual text, listening to soothing, holistic music to raise your vibrations, or creative stuff like painting.The length of the breaks can be just 1 minute to start benefiting us.
