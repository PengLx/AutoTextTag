Title: The art of disagreement Content: Mastering the art of considerate disagreement means expressing your beliefswithout shutting down the discussion or angering the other side.For this to happen, you have to listen more, be willing to change your perspective on disagreement and learn to better your arguments.
Title: Escape your own bias Content: Take the time to gather facts that support the opposite point of view.Ask yourself,“What if I’m wrong?”. This will strengthen your argument by anticipating questions, or you’re going to learn something new and take a more nuanced position.
Title: Listening to the other side Content: We tend to focus on what we're going to say next in conversation and we fail to understand the counterargument and really listen to the other party.Demonstrate that you're listening by reframing their position in your words and then ask forconfirmation that you have it right.
Title: Present your ideas inclusively Content: Disagreements can create an “us versus them” mentality with clear winners and losers.A better approach is to ditch the entire notion of winners and losers. Instead, you’re both on the same team working toward a better solution.
Title: Disagreement is healthy Content: It is essential for success. It’s the hallmark of an engaged and involved team member. And it opens the way for testing and improving new ideas.It should also be treated as a chance to built trust and show mutual understanding.
