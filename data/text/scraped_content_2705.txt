To survive they needed to cooperate with in-group members while also competing for mates and limited resources.It was fundamental to know who was reliable, trustworthy, a cheater, a good mate and so on. To that end, an intense interest in the private dealings of others was beneficial and favored by natural selection.
Title: Social Isolation Content: Sharing secrets is one way people bond, so avoiding gossip may lead to social isolation.Someone skillful at gossip can be socially informed and have a good rapport with others. On the other hand,someone who doesn’t gossip maybecome an outsider, neither trusted nor accepted by the group.Gossip also helps to integrate newcomers into groups by exposing group norms and values.
