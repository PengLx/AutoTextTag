Title: Why people comply when they are nudged Content: Biases are hardwired and difficult to change. To change behavior, attention is not paid to countering the problematic thoughts, judgments, or predictions. Instead, it has been directed to changing the behavior in the form of incentives or "nudges."For example, employers have been able to nudge employees into contributing to retirement plans by making saving the default option; you have to actively take steps to not participate.
