Title: Action Has The Power To Improve Our Mood Content: We normally think our mind makes our body get into action, but the reverse is also true: Action has the power to improve our low mood.When one is down in the dumps, even simple chores need a lot of effort. The ongoing global crisis has had many activities that one enjoys to be indefinitely cancelled, leading to withdrawal.
Title: The Depression Cycle Content: Depression can be distilled down into a problematic cycle due to reduced activity and low mood: when there is less activity, the person becomes withdrawn or isolated, and new opportunities become less likely, leading to a downward spiral.Prolonged isolation and inactivity make previously enjoyable activities challenging or unappealing, making people withdraw further.
Title: Behavioural Activation Content: The Behavioral Theory states that positive reinforcement acts as oxygen for the body/mind/soul, and makes the person break the cycle of negativity and depression.The depression cycle of inactivity can be broken by Behavioural Activation which is an effective depression therapy in psychology. The depressed people are made to engage in activities they have stopped doing or are reluctant to do now.
Title: Behavioral Activation Action Mode Content: Ensure variety in the activities, and strike a balance between pleasurable, routine and necessary ones. Avoid prolonged inactivity periods and remember that challenging activities provide a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, boosting one’s mood.Carry out the activities even if you don’t feel like it, and let the body cure the mind.Do self-evaluation on a daily basis and be patient with yourself.
