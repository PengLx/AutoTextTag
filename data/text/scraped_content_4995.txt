Title: A Hot Bath Content: Having a hot bath is practiced in many cultures and recent studies point out that ‘passive heating’ of the body improves health in several ways.A hot bath controls the blood sugar of the body and increased its anti-inflammatory response.This passive heating technique can improve heart functions, lowering one’s blood pressure, and eventually helping people with type 2 diabetes.
Title: Heat Shock Content: Taking a long sauna bath or soaking in the hot tub is beneficial for people who are unable to exercise regularly. The passive heating technique can improve heart functions, lowering one’s blood pressure, and eventually helping people with type 2 diabetes.Further studies on how heating affects health suggest the presence of ‘heat shock proteins’ in the body, produced by all cells of the human body in response to stress, that are responsible for these bodily changes. These proteins are now being further investigated.
