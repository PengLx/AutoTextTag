Title: Ask a Lot Of Questions Content: People who ask lots of questions are rated more likable than their conversation partners than people who ask fewer questions. Follow-up questions (ones related to something you've just been discussing) are especially helpful.
Title: Nod Attentively While Others Speak Content: People who nod while others speak were rated more likeable, attractive, and approachable than those who shook their head or stayed still.Nodding three times in quick succession after people stop talking has been found to encourage people to keep talking.
Title: Know When To Be Personal Content: Revealing something highly intimate, especially something negative, early on in a relationship, suggests that you're insecure and can decrease your likability.Discussing favorite hobbies and your happy childhood memories and gradually opening up is a better approach.
Title: Highly Empathetic Content: More emotionally intelligent and empathetic employees got along better with colleagues and achieved higher company ranks, while highly empathic managers lead better-performing teams.To be more empathetic ask open-ended questions, listen actively, and ask others what they would do in a particular situation before offering advice.
Title: A Good Sense Of Humor Content: Being consistently funny establishes a good first impression, makes people like you, and is a sought after trait for new relationships.Research also says that participating in a humorous task (like having someone wear a blindfold while the other person teaches them a dance) can increase romantic attraction.
Title: Let People Talk About Themselves Content: People like talking about themselves and those who let them.Research shows brain regions associated with motivation and reward being most active when participants were sharing information publicly — but also were active when they were talking about themselves without anyone listening.
Title: Not Being Perfect Content: Revealing imperfections can make you seem more relatable and vulnerable toward the people around you.Simple mistakes can affect perceived attraction positively. But it’s best if you reveal that you're competent before making a mistake to avoid appearing silly.
Title: Show Positive Emotions Content: People can unconsciously feel the emotions of those around them. We naturally mimic others' movements and facial expressions, which in turn makes us feel something similar to what they're feeling.If you're generally upbeat and enthusiastic, other people will feel the same when you're around.
Title: Make a Great First Impression Content: First impressions influence people’s perceptions even after they meet in person, but there are ways to reverse a bad first impression.For example, if someone views you negatively, you can help them see your behavior in a new context.
