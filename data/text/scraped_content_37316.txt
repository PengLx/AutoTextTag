Title: Inattention caused by multitasking Content: Recent research describes multitasking as paying insufficient attention to multiple things at once.Another new study found it is even worse than that - it prevents people from remembering what they've done and seen, especially is they move from screen to screen.
Title: Media multitasking Content: Moving continually between screen-based activities, such as texting, checking Instagram, or watching a video may make us forget information we want to remember.Even though we continually devour information, we will be left frustrated because we're not able to bring knowledge to mind to express what we know. In an experimental exercise, researchers found that people who are less able to sustain attention and those who reported being heavy media multitaskers both performed worse at memory tasks.
Title: Strengthening your memory Content: Remembering occurs best when it's goal-oriented. The things that happen before you begin remembering will affect whether or not you can actually reactivate a memory that is relevant to your current goal.Paying attention to your attentiveness may help you stay aware and prepared to store new memories of what you are currently doing.
