Title: Straightforward people Content: Straightforward people are easy to be around with because we know exactly what the issues are from the start. There is no need to guess or infer or translate. If they don't want to do something, they will politely tell you it's not for them. If they are unhappy with your behavior, they will gently tell you how they view the situation.
Title: Complicated people Content: Complicated people are very unsure about the legitimacy of their own desires, making them unable to let the world know what they really want and feel.They may initially appear to agree with everything you're saying, but later on, their reservations will become known. They will say they want to join you for dinner but will inwardly ache for an early night. They will give the impression of being happy while crying inside. They will say sorry when they want you to apologize.
Title: The reason for confusing complexity Content: The root cause of confusing complexity may come from fear of how an audience might respond if our real intentions are known.The origins may have started in childhood. A child becomes complicated when they are given the impression that there is no room for their honesty. A child may have received irritation or open anger for their honesty.
Title: We don't have to stay complicated Content: We can change by noticing and growing curious about the origins of our habitual evasiveness. We can realise that no one will shout at us if we reveal our aspirations. Or if they do, we can walk away.We can also recognise that our complicated behaviour doesn't have the effect of pleasing people. Most people prefer to deal with frustration head on rather than listening to a nice story and then have to suffer disappointment.
