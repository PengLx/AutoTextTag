Title: Keep the Same Schedule Content: To give your day structure, keep the same routine as when you went into an office. Get up at the same time and make a to-do list. Check in with the same person every morning.Your schedule will change over time as you adjust to your new working arrangement.
Title: Set Boundaries Content: Pick a place for your office away from distraction.Boundaries also apply to other people who may be sharing the same space. Children can work alongside you as if they were coming to the office.
Title: Schedule Breaks Content: You won't have the same cues as you do from your workplace to remind you to get up or get lunch. When you lose the pace of your day, everything can start to blend together.Treat your exercise, meals and stretch breaks as you would any other meeting. Put it on your calendar, at least to start.
Title: Prepare for Isolation Content: Proactively stay in touch with others rather than waiting for someone to reach out. It could be emailing colleagues more often, using chat tools or just picking up the phone.Getting a pet is another way to break isolation, or playing a familiar movie for a background hum to break the silence.
Title: Put Work Away Content: The evening commute is often a way to end the workday and beginning home life.It is important to continue to end your workday when you work from home, even if you only move to a different spot in your home or shut down your work applications.
