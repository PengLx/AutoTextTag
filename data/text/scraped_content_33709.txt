Title: 2020: The Days Go By So Fast Content: We play with time in a blindfolded fashion, wasting hours trying to work even though our concentration has left us long ago. Our leisure time feels timeless and hypnotic, due to everything from movies to social media being turned into a meaningless infinity.We need to set boundaries to this vastness to stay sane, or time will leave us before we know it.
Title: Pomodoro: A New Time Management Technique Content: The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that breaks every activity, be it reading a book, journaling or anything you do, into 25 minute intervals, followed by a 5 minute break. Four ‘intervals’ of Pomodoro require a longer break, and the emphasis is to stop after every 25 minutes.This technique gets you out of your infinity haze and sets boundaries to your day. It makes you self-aware, making hours feel longer and more productive.
