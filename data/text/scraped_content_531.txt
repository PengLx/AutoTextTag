Title: Reduce the stress of clutter Content: Apply constraints and stick to them: to tabs open in your browser, notebooks, magazines etc.Use small storage spaces: Less room means less room for clutter.Set time aside to clean, sort, and discard every single month.Clean your desktop at the end of every workday so to-do items don’t linger and you’ve got a clean slate to start with the next day.
Title: Find places that inspire you Content: You might not be in a position to choose your workspace, but there are quick fixes: look for a spot with natural light from a window or skylight, take a walk outside when you feel stuck, or simply explore a new location.A new environment can quite literally lead to new ideas.
Title: Task association Content: It's when your brain knows that when you’re in a certain place, you’re taking a certain action.Take advantage of the way different locations affect you. Our brains love habits, and if we can associate certain qualities with different places, it can help us get into a better working flow.
Title: Designing for laziness Content: If you want to create a workspace that’s productive, focus on making it easier to do the things you want to do, and harder to do the tasks you don’t.Our brains have been taught to conserve energy at all costs and make subconscious decisions for us based entirely on how hard or easy it is.
Title: Noise and productivity Content: If you can’t find a spot that’s silent, noise cancelling headphones or music that drowns out speech can help regain that focus, especially if you work inshared spaces or offices.The sounds around you and the music you listen to can have a huge impact on your productivity.
