Title: Disengaged Employees Content: Engagement at work is a sign of employee motivation and resulting productivity. Unfortunately, only about 13% of people globally are engaged at work, and disengaged employees cost the economy $500 billion per year. Work engagement has a direct correlation with performance.There is a dire need to increase our ability to collaborate with disengaged and less motivated employees.
Title: What Not To Do Content: Do not make assumptions about a disengaged employee's performance. While statistically, such employees do underperform, there can be other reasons too.Do not force an employee to be someone they are not. Everyone cannot be happy and optimistic all the time.Do not get emotional, and stick to a transactional, formal, work-focused style. Do not expect to win their hearts or influence them by appealing to their emotions.Do not assign employees tasks beyond their area of expertise.
Title: Approaching Disengaged Employees Content: Use extrinsic motivating factors such as incentives and rewards to get productivity from a disengaged employee.Understand what drives them, connect with them, gaining their trust and respect without being emotional, and focus on what they value.Respect an employee's personal space and their need to distance their problems from their work.Ultimately, it is what an employee delivers that matters most, and a manager has to focus on figuring out how to get the work done.
