Title: The Peter Principle Content: It describes what can happen when an employee does well in one job and is subsequently promoted. She/he does well in the new role and is promoted again. This continues up and until the employee is put in a position where she stops performing well and is, therefore, left in a position where she is incompetent.
Title: Avoiding the Peter principle Content: Commit to continuous learning:heading off to a career thinking youâ€™ve learned all you needed to know for the next 40-50 years is a sure way to find yourself stuck in a position you cannot move beyond;Be mindful of what you are good at:there are certain career fields each of us know we are not best suited for.
