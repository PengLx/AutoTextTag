Title: Seeking silence Content: As our internal and external environments become louder and louder, more people are beginning to seek out silence, whether through a practice of sitting quietly for 10 minutes every morning or heading off to a 10-day silent retreat.
Title: Silence relieves tension Content: Noise pollution may lead to high blood pressure and heart attacks, as well as impairing hearing and overall health. Loud noises raise stress levels by activating the brain’s amygdala and causing the release of the stress hormone cortisol, according to research.Silence has the opposite effect, releasing tension in the brain and body.

Title: The brain’s default mode network Content: Engaging this network helps us to make meaning out of our experiences, empathize with others, be more creative and reflect on our own mental and emotional states.In order to do this, it’s necessary to break away from the distractions.
Title: Regenerating brain cells Content: Silence can quite literally grow the brain.Research found thattwo hours of silence daily led to the development of new cells in the hippocampus, a key brain region associated with learning, memory and emotion.
