Title: Laptops vs pen and paper Content: In an experiment, students were given Ted Talks to watch and were told to take notes, half with laptops, the other with pen and paper.The students using a keyboard were more likely to type the lecturers' words verbatim without processing the information.The students writing by hand were slower and had no choice but to engage with the information in order to write down summaries. Afterwards, they were better able to explain the concepts covered in the lecture.
Title: Recording lectures Content: Recording lectures to replay later has shown to have no added benefits compared to paying attention the first time without the possibility of watching it again.The advantage of watching it again is that you don't have to worry about taking notes and can focus your full attention on it.The benefit of taking notes is that it forces you to process the information and think about it before you can summarize it.
