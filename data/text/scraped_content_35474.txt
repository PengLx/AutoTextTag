Title: The Anomaly Of Bad Events Content: Bad news, like a catastrophic event, war, or death, happens quickly and instantly, and spreads like wildfire. A bad event does not take time to manifest, though the foundations have been laid long back, off the radar.Good things take time and happen so slowly that nobody notices that there have been gradual improvements and the problem has now declined or subsided.
Title: The Compounding Effect of News Content: Heart disease has declined 1.5 percent per year, and if that news is on the internet, it is not likely to go viral. But what is overlooked is the compounding effect, which is invisible in the short run, and only noticeable after 15 to 20 years.
Title: Good News: Too Slow To Notice Content: New technologies often take decades to become mainstream. A trickle of growth, progress or innovation does not create a ripple or spike in most people's lives.Example: Netflix stock has grown exponentially in the last 20 odd years, but almost none of the investors have benefited entirely from it, as the progress has been too slow to be noticed.
Title: Bad News Creates A Sonic Boom Content: Bad news is aggressive and attention grabbing. A pandemic took no time to put the entire world hostage. Events like Pearl Harbour and 9/11 only took a couple of hours.All growth is slow to rise, as it fights against many odds. A tree takes a lifetime to grow from a seed in the soil to itâ€™s full-blown form, where it gives shade, fruit and environmental support to all.Setbacks are fast and furious, as they have entropy to their advantage.
