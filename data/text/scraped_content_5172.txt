Title: Breadcrumbed At Work Content: Breadcrumbing is a corporate practice in which the employee is provided the bare minimum or less than optimal information, feedback, rewards by the manager, keeping it a one-way communication.The employee feels dejected, unvalued and confused. He has to work harder due to the opacity and limited set of information. He is kept in the dark as crucial information is not shared with him easily. There is no encouragement or listening to new ideas.
Title: The Opposite Of Empowered Content: The employee cannot invest in a career if there is no visible sign of a career in the first place. The employee feels disposable and undervalued in the organization, with the manager ghosting him at times.Important information is thrust upon the employee, rather than taking his opinion first.There is no interest of the employer in employee development or empowerment.
