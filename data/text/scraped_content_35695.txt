Title: Our Working Memory Content: The limited amount of load we can take on our working memory, which functions like computer RAM, is called the cognitive load. Miller's Law states that we need to limit our cognitive loads and hold on to approximately seven number of objects at a given time.
Title: Balancing Our Mental Effort Content: To increase our learning performance, we need to balance our cognitive load. It helps to understand what the three types of cognitive loads are:Intrinsic cognitive Load: The inner load we feel when we are calculating something complex. This is a fixed load on the brain.Extraneous cognitive load: Presenting information or a task in a certain way, like visually or verbally, making it easier to understand.Germane cognitive load: It is the flow-chart constructions of the brain, which help in long-term learning. The mind makes information easier to grasp by creating maps and inner processes, helping us understand better.
Title: Tools To Manage The Cognitive Load Content: Grouping or chunking of various pieces of information into different sections, making them easier to retrieve and remember.Making mind maps or process maps, and also thinking in maps making constructive associations and flow-charts.Clearing your mind by taking your thoughts out of it and projecting it where they are better visualized. This is also known as brain-dumping, and writing is a good way to understand context, build associations and improve memory.Collaborating with others using brainstorming sessions, Idea-meets, or creating a learning plan together as a team, confluence style.
