Title: Self-Control Content: Self-control, an ability to overcome your current state of want or desire, and appreciate the needs of your future self, is similar to the feelings of empathy and selflessness, which essentially is the same ability projected on others.The feelings of self-control and empathy generate from the area of our brain known as the right temporoparietal junction.
Title: The Theory Of Mind Content: The Right Temporoparietal Junctionpart of our brain helps us think about other people, understanding their mental states.If this region is well developed and better connected to other parts of the brain, people behave altruistically and show less bias in their groups. If this region is impaired, people lose their sense of morality.New studies about this region of the brain tell us that impulsivity and selfishness are linked, and are the opposite of restraint and empathy.
