Title: Travelling And Philosophy Content: Recreational and exploratory travel has two main motivations; travel for 'change' for new experiences, leading to inner transformation, and travel to 'show', which revolves around displaying your experiences to others.Exploratory travel, seeking out unknown, exotic and unexplored places, has its mental equivalent in philosophy, which is also about exploring the unknown, internally.
Title: The Same Journey Content: Travelers and philosophers are pushing the limits of their knowledge, seeing how the world works. There is an undeniable link in exploring the oceans and even other planets, and in crafting radically new questions delving into the mind's uncharted territory.The tools may be different, but the essential journey is the same, with travelers affecting philosophy and philosophers affecting travel.
