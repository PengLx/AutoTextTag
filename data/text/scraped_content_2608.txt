Title: Ignorance is Bliss Content: Sometimes things get heated in the office, and people lose their temper. It happens when people are working hard and trying to do their best.If you trust your team and know your colleagues well enough to recognize something as just out of character, it might be best to just let it blow over before addressing it any further.
Title: Evasive Maneuvers Content: Sometimes, things don’t seem to calm down on their own, and some sort of intervention is clearly needed.If you’re fairly in tune with your colleagues and can pinpoint a relevant segue, jump on that chance. You’ll help get the discussion back on track and help save your colleagues from saying something they might regret.
Title: Mediate Content: When you feel a conversation heating up—fast—it’s probably time to step in and help mediate.Pay close attention to the argument, and try to find some common ground between the two (or more) battling it out. If you can’t find anything, then come up with a suggestion of your own. Try to ease the tension, not add fuel to the fire.
