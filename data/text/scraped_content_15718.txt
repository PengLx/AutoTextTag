Title: Intermittent fasting Content: Intermittent fasting is a process that enables you to lose weight by mixing a low-calorie diet with unrestricted eating throughout the week. The issue is that many individuals tend to disobey this diet without even wanting it.Intermittent fasting is a way of losing weight that favours flexibility over calorie counting. It restricts the time you are allowed to eat, which reduces calorie intake by limiting opportunities to eat.
Title: Recovering calorie deficit Content: While intermittent fasting has as main purpose to make the large calorie deficit remain unchanged after a period of fasting or low-calorie dieting, studies have shown that actually a combination of eating just a bit more and doing less physical activity can help recover half of this calorie deficit.
Title: Intermittent fasting and its flexibility Content: When deciding on the best way to lose weight, intermittent fasting might be just the proper way for you. Due to its flexibility, this type of diet enables you to lose weight while still enjoying good meals. However, it is entirely up to you to decide on the outcome of the diet, whatever this is.
