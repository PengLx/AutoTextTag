Title: The influencer Content: The term "influencer" may not produce thoughts of profound social or economic disruption, but it has changed the way we measure success as societies.An influencer selling us stuff is a powerful driving force of change and presents a new opportunity for entrepreneurial success.
Title: Democratizing fame (and fortune) Content: The market used to be primarily controlled by a handful of entities - agents, entertainment studios, managers, and advertisers.This is no longer the case. The power has been handed back to consumers who are redefining fame and adding diversity to fields that have been too narrow.
Title: Valorizing “real” Content: The influencer model gave consumers the power to support people they actually believe in and turn regular folks into icons. The key to success is the ability to authentically connect with fans.Today's influencer-entrepreneurs have tools available to handle marketing, sales, and fulfillment almost on their own. The consumers hand their dollars for a product and a person they actually believe in.
Title: Raising the bar Content: A benefit of the influencer model is that it helps to replace the market of VIP-backed junk products. Fans can now provide feedback directly to the products they support.Putting a celebrity endorsement on a product is no longer enough - a successful influencer brand has value and quality.
