Title: Existential Angst And Our Future Content: We are increasingly faced with global issues related to politics, climate change, war, and other existential threats.The normal tendency is to worry endlessly and repeatedly think about things that have happened, which can lead to depression.The troubling fact is that if the threat is massive, we feel helpless and end up thinking more about the same.
Title: Anxiety Due To Climate Change Content: The American Psychological Association (APA) defines Eco-Anxiety as a mental health issue due to climate change. This and other existential threats are processed in the anterior cingulate cortex(ACC), a region of our brain that is also responsible for our behaviour.Eco-Anxiety cannot be treated as it is not a specific mental health problem (yet), and we need to calm our mind by taking affirmative action. We need to concentrate on what can be controlled, taking step-by-step action, no matter how small it is, like recycling or buying second-hand, to minimize our environmental impact on the planet.
