Title: Promotion of Position = Demotion of Value Content: When a person is promoted, they usually turn to different responsibilities and roles which requires completely different skills and insights.Later on, the company will notice that they made a mistake in choosing the right person but will not want to admit it. As a result, the position will be maintained but will either end up unfilled due to voluntary resignation or imminent dismissal of the person.
Title: Experience is not everything Content: Experience is a good thing, but this does not automatically make an employee the best person to be promoted to a more responsible job.Before promoting an employee, the company should know the employee's level of knowledge, skills and ambitions. They should know if that person really deserves that spot.
