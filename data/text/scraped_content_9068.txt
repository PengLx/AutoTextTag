Title: Dalgona coffee Content: Over the past few weeks, as many of us retreat inside, dalgona coffee has become an online global coffee trend.Tutorials and posts are displaying the making of dalgona coffee, which consists of milk topped with a thick layer of coffee foam that's made by vigorously mixing instant coffee, sugar, and water.
Title: A new drink Content: Unlike a latte or a cappuccino, in which the froth comes from aerated milk, the fluffiness of dalgona coffee comes from the coffee and sugar itself.Dalgona coffee was almost nonexistent until January 26 this year. A Korean YouTuber posted a clip where he uses a mixer to whip coffee, sugar, and water into a foam so thick it looks more like frosting or caramel pudding and then dollops it onto a glass of milk.
Title: The coffee trend Content: Because people are called to stay indoors, and many cafes are closed during the outbreak, people are more open to trying out this drink at home.The simplicity of the recipe makes it popular. Most people have sugar and instant coffee in their pantries. It is also fun to see everyone make their own version of a recipe and share their experiences.
