Title: Running Away From Life Content: We tend to avoid situations that test us, or are terrifying personally, even though they may be necessary or required professionally. Unpleasant tasks are often required for us to get ahead in life.Without the skill or courage to handle such tasks, we miss out on opportunities of advancing in our lives.
Title: Easy When You Know How Content: We normally avoid stuff that is unfamiliar to us. If we embrace it, by learning about it and making it something we are adept at, we will be more willing to minimize our discomfort and make the activity/task palpable and even enjoyable. To borrow a saying from a children’s book: It’s easy when you know how to do it.
Title: Just Do It Content: To get rid of our fear and anxiety, it is important to take the plunge. What we fear is mostly smoke and mirrors, something that was bothering us psychologically but had no substance. When we take the plunge, we dispel the self-belief that the task is impossible.In the case of public speaking, we need to build our confidence by taking the plunge, initially with a small audience, and gradually building it. Start with small steps. It is ok if you stumble.You will come out a different person when you accomplish what you fear.
