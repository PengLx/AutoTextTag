Title: Changing eating habits Content: Nowadays we all tend to turn or meals into sheer cultural experiences. This is to say, we have let ourselves so much influenced by whatever is being posted on social media, that we no longer care about the amount of wasted food, as long as the food we consume looks in a certain way.However, besides the waste that is being produced, there is also the issue of our diet that should be our main concern, as not always the food we see online is good for us.
Title: The evolution of our eating standards Content: While we are so busy trying to copy whatever dish we see on TV, we are also slowly ending up losing the pleasure of cooking. Preparing food, especially the fancy one we see displayed on commercials, can be quite exhausting after an eight hours working day. Therefore, we come fast to the conclusion that we should order instead of wasting any minute on cooking ourselves. The real risk of this fast changing industry refers, nevertheless, to the fact that we tend to lose sight of what we should actually eat in order to be healthy. With all these recommendations coming from all sides, there is so little room for clarity on the topic.
