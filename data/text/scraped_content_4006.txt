Title: Influencing consumers Content: Near the end of the year, attempts to influence consumer behavior abounds with ways to "improve yourself" in the new year. They remind the consumer that you're still the same imperfect person they've always been.The commodification of inadequacy is clear: You have some work you should be doing, and these companies have some related products to help you realize your goal.
