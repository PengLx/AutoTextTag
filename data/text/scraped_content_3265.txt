Title: Consistency allows for measurement Content: Until you have tried something new for a period of time and in a consistent manner, you can't decide if it works or not.How do you measure effectiveness if what you are measuring isn't performed consistently?
Title: Consistency creates accountability Content: Be accountable for your deliverables and goals.The simple fact that there is a set time to report on progress is often the catalyst that moves an initiative along to a successful end.
Title: Consistency and reputation Content: Business growth requires a track record of success. You can't establish a track record if you are constantly shifting gears or trying new tactics.Many efforts fail before they get to the finish line, but not because the tactic was flawed or goals weren't clear. The problem is often that the team simply didn't stay the course to achieve the objective.
Title: Consistency makes you relevant Content: You need to set a predictable flow of information. All too often, businesses, both small and large, adopt a campaign or initiative only to end it before it gains traction.It's effective to run many advertisements, numerous blog entries, weekly newsletters, or continual process changes throughout a year.
Title: Consistency maintains your message Content: The people you work with pay as much or more attention to what you do as to what you say. Especially if you're a leader, consistency in your work serves as a model for how your employees will behave.If you treat a meeting as unimportant, don't be surprised when you find they are doing the same to fellow teammates or even customers.
