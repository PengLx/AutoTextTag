Title: Attach reason to the task Content: Getting motivated about a task doesn’t mean you have to be happy or excited about it. Sometimes you must ask yourself: Why is this task important? What will it bring about in my life? The answer could be as simple as I won’t get fired.
Title: Your unwillingness to get started Content: Have you ever had a looming deadline on a big project only to spend an inordinate amount of time cleaning out your refrigerator or detailing your car?If you struggle to get started on a project until it’s crunch time, you might have an unhealthy relationship with stress.Research shows thatpeople can be just as addicted to stress as they are to likes on their social media posts.
Title: Use the 15-minute rule Content: You can accomplish quite a bit in just 15 minutes, and yet most of us fritter away that time on our phones in between meetings or during a commute.Commit to working on a put-off task for 15 minutes without interruption. Stop at 15 minutes. Don’t allow yourself to work any longer. Do this every day for a week and mark your progress.
