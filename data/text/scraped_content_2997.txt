Title: Recharging your energy Content: Just as you need to refuel your car and recharge the batteries in your cell phone, it’s important to give yourself the chance to recoup your energy levels throughout the workday.
Title: Fully switch off Content: We're usually tempted to spend breaks doing things that are convenient but aren’t truly restful (internet shopping, browsing the latest news, etc.)But brief work breaks are only genuinely rejuvenating when they give you the chance to fully switch off. Any kind of activity that involves willpower or concentration, even if it’s not in a work context, is only going to add to your fatigue levels.
Title: Take short breaks early and often Content: The timing of our breaks makes a difference.Although it may be tempting to wait until we’re flagging later in the day before allowing ourselves a short break, we actually respond better to breaks in the morning - it seems we need to have some fuel in the tank to benefit from a re-fill.
Title: Get out of the office Content: One problem with staying in the officeis that even if you take a decent lunch break and chat with colleagues, there’s still that pressure to maintain a good impression.If you can get outside, even if it’s just a five-minute walk around the block, you can also benefit from a rejuvenating dose of nature.
