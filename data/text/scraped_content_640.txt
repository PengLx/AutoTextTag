Title: Basic structure of an argument from incredulity Content: Premise 1: I can’t explain or imagine how proposition X can be true.Premise 2: if a certain proposition is true, then I must be able to explain or imagine how that can be.Conclusions: proposition X is false.
Title: It’s ok to be incredulous Content: ... and to bring this up as part of an argument. The issue with doing so occurs when this incredulity isn’t justified or supported by concrete information, and when this lack of belief is used in order to assume that a preferred personal explanation must be the right one, despite the lack of proof.At the same time, it’s also important to remember that it’s possible that the person using the argument from incredulity is right, despite the fact that their reasoning is flawed.
Title: Counter the argument from incredulity Content: Explain why this sort of reasoning is fallacious:namely the fact that your opponent’s inability to explain a certain phenomenon or to understand a certain theory, does not invalidate current explanations for it.Shift the burden of proof back to your opponent:ask them to support their initial assertion, and explain why they are incredulous, and why they think that this validates their position. If possible, you should show that there is scientific evidence that can be used in order to explain the phenomenon that’s being discussed.
Title: The argument from incredulity Content: Is a logical fallacy where someone concludes that since they can’t believe that a certain concept is true, then it must be false and vice versa.Its 2 basic forms:“I can’t imagine how X can be true; therefore, X must be false.”“I can’t imagine how X can be false; therefore, X must be true.”
