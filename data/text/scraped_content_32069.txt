Title: Product Market For is a Myth Content: There is no clear or consistent demarcation for fit vs. non-fit. Fundemantally it boils down to a “feeling,” rather than a scientifically measurable binary. And this leads entrepreneurs to make silly mistakes:  They are told to believe that pre-fit is a time for discovery and learning while post-fit is a time for scale. But product strategy shouldn’t do a 180° based on an arbitrary “feeling” of fit vs. non-fit.Marketers take a hands-off  approach before product-market fit is declared. They declare “we can’t find product-market fit,” when in fact, they didn’t invest enough in finding customers, at profitable rates, to sustain the business.
Title: Customer Adoption Spectrum Content: Instead of chasing mythical PMF for we should focus on customer segments.If the product is resonating with a small group of early-adopting customers who fit a particular mold, we can do marketing to go after more potential new customers like them, while doing product iteration to better servel a future high-potential group. If I’m very early in the process, I might be marketing and building for only a single, narrow group. But as the product’s adoption grows, that will almost certainly evolve.
