Title: “Phubbing” Content: Is snubbing someone you’re talking to to look at a cell phone.Just think about how often a conversation stalls because your friends (or you) have pulled out a phone and descended into an Instagram black hole.It's annoying and may be hurting your relationships.
Title: Paradox of Phubbing Content: Phubbing is meant to connect you, presumably, with someone through social media or texting. But it actually can severely disrupt your present-moment, in-person relationships and in the end makes you feel even less connected.
Title:  Content: Phubbing threatens the 4 “fundamental needs” - belongingness, self-esteem, meaningful existence and control - by making phubbed people feel excluded and ostracized.
Title: Get over Phubbing Content: Creating and following strict technology rules, such as putting your phone away while eating dinner, can help you form new habits. Other attention-based practices, like meditation and mindfulness, may also help re-train your attentional capacity.
