Title: Time and attention Content: A leader’s most precious resource is not their time. It’s their focused attention.If you're able to direct your attention toward a particular task or discussion, you'll have a powerful impact in a minimal amount of time.
Title: Build capacity Content: Activities likemeditation, journaling, time in nature, regular physical activity, and good sleep hygiene support and expand our attentive capacity and our ability to direct focus and block distractions.While these activities are often enjoyable in themselves, they aren’t indulgences–they’re investments in our ability to operate at peak effectiveness.
Title: Avoid attention leaks Content: Our attention and ability to focus in the moment are very limited. Our devices, with all their notifications and messages, create a false sense of urgency.Ask yourself: How often are any of these interruptions truly urgent?
Title: Create space Content: ... for creative thinking. It helps refill your stores of attention.Leaders typically are bombarded with demands on their time and if they’re not careful they can find themselves booked nonstop for days on end. It’s important to maintain some open space in the calendar.
