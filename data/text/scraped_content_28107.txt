Title: My Red Is Your Blue Content: About 1 per cent of American men suffer from red-green colour blindness. Recent experiments challenge the accepted notion that all of us have the same default perception of the colours we see. A person’s red could be the other person’s blue, technically, but still carry with it the same feeling. Example: The colour of blood (deep red) or the blue sky could seem different to some people while carrying the same feeling or emotion when they encounter it.
Title: The Calculations Of Light Content: The colour-sensitive receptors that humans have, called melanopsin, measure the amount of blue or yellow light in the atmosphere and likewise regulate our circadian rhythm. Human beings have Cone Cells, which are of three types, Red, Blue, and Green, and have evolved much later than the receptors in the brain.
Title: Colour Is A Private Sensation Content: Research proves that the universal emotional responses that we have when we see a colour tend to be the same, even if the actual colour is different, as our conscious perception of those colours varies.The day-night cycle of living things is impacted by the ambient light, where the morning yellow light awakens us or makes us feel happy, and the dominance of blue light at night makes us feel sleepy.
