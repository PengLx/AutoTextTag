SXSW, for instance, went virtual within weeks and even partnered with Amazon Prime for an online Film Festival.Digital solutions are the way forward for many other film festivals, as otherwise, they lose millions in and revenue while scrambling for viewers and distributors for their projects.

The streamed screenings and online question and answer sessions bring in unexpected benefits coupled with a vaster reach, due to the elimination of physical constraints and logistical issues associated with big events.Case in Point: Disabled audiences were earlier unable to access or be part of the event, and were now optimistic about the technological elements deployed, which helped them tremendously.
Title: The Digital Ecosystem Content: The digital content ecosystem, once matured, can work as a marketplace for exclusive movie distribution and online screenings of sought-after titles.While some people still prefer the 'community' allure of a physical festival, with its glamour, energy and buzz, the digital version is here to stay.
