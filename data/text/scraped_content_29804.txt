Title:  Content: Suga's rap has changed little since that campaign. Today he's known as a successful political operator, who can be relied on to get things done -- qualities that made him an excellent right-hand man to Abe."He's got a very good story ... He's very much a self-made man. The question, however, is the degree to which he has a personality that can shine through," said Glosserman, the author of "Peak Japan: The End of Great Ambitions."If elected, Suga could be forced to sell himself to the public very soon. The government must hold another general election by October 2021, but Defense Minister Taro Konosaid Wednesday that snap elections could be called as early as next month.As chief cabinet secretary, Suga was widely viewed as a successful spokesman because he was able to communicate a message without overshadowing it or his boss. But that same skill could prove a problem in the top job, in which oratory and charisma are important traits in order to communicate a message to the public.
