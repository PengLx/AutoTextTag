Title: Balance is not the same as rest Content: It’s not about rest and  finally getting that much-needed break, though it does include these aspects.Balance is about distributing demands so we can stay on track. And sometimes that takes a lot of work.
Title: Balance is dynamic Content: Momentum helps us stay on course. It’s the same for all the corrections and adjustments we make along the way.Balance requires tweaking our schedule, task lists, and more. If you have it right one week, it still requires attention the next.
Title: Balance is intentional Content: We have to make purposeful decisions and actions if we want balance. It’s not accidental.Those decisions and actions will look different for each of us, but they’re essential for all of us just the same.
