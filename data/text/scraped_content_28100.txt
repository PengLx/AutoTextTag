Title: Chronically Late People Content: While dealing with a chronically late friend or acquaintance, one tends to assume as though the person has disrespected us by not valuing our time. This may not be true.People who are frequently late can also be optimists or creative individuals who have presence of mind and can think on their feet.
Title: The Three Behavioral Patterns of People That Are Late Content: Being habitually late has been pointed towards three main categories of behaviour:Being under the impression that they can multitask and function optimally under pressure.Being thrilled or fascinated by the constant stream of distractions and trying to participate in the next bright and shiny thing that comes in front of them.Being unaware of the actual time or not being able to calculate or experience time in the normal way.
Title: Handling The Chronically Late Content: Become autonomous and act independently in your plans.Donâ€™t depend on others for travel arrangements.Do not give others your ticket to a concert or movie.Take a book with you to get absorbed into while you wait, much better than fidgeting with your smartphone.Call them once a certain lateness threshold has been crossed.Make your feelings known but do not criticize them.Re-evaluate what is there to gain from the relation and what you lose if you let go of the same.
