Title: The Time Domain Content: Time measurement seems so crucial that athletes forget what to do without any measurement of time.Running an interval without any clock makes you keep in touch with your internal feelings and energy levels.
Title: Disrupted Content: Disruption and a skewing of your personal space is a way to challenge your comfort zone and grow towards becoming a seasoned athlete who can perform in unfamiliar territory.
Title: To Each His Own Content: Every race is a search for your individual limits. In an interval workout, the coach tells you exactly how many repetitions to do, and then you stop. The limit is imposed externally.For athletes to run to their maximum potential in races, they are the ones that should decide how many repetitions they needed to do in order to reach exhaustion.
Title: Skewing the Plan Content: Similar to disrupting the number of reps, or timing, we can skew the planning of the workout structure, allowing individual athletes to fine-tune it according to their own preference and stamina.
