Title: Consider the context Content: We can fall victim to psychological barriers when we try to cling to general wisdom and favor absolutes, rather than act as we should. We implement best practices without considering the context. It could happen when we prefer to try and fit into someone else's mold for what "success" looks like instead of thinking for ourselves.If we stopped obsessing over the right answers and instead acted like investigators, we could overcome these psychological barriers.
Title: Pike Syndrome Content: It's a feeling of powerlessness caused by repeated negative events.Maybe youâ€™re a designer whose boss keeps shooting down ideas, for example.In school, we are taught that there are right and wrong answers, and we learn to treat every task at work like we have to find the right answer. We don't look for a better option because we are only concerned with the right answer.
Title: The Foraging Choice Content: It's the decision between using your current position and exploring other options. When we are stressed, we will rather hold on to our current position and exploit it than searching for another opportunity.However, if we looked at our current position in context, we would be more confident to try something else. It means understanding what you want to achieve in the future and how you take advantage of today.
Title: Cultural Fluency Content: It's your behavior when the world unfolds according to the expected norm. When there's a cultural fit, we don't really think. We go with the flow. It is only when there is a disconnect that we start to hesitate.If we start doing something different, like taking another route to work, we become more mindful. We can also ask "why?" or "how did it make you feel?" to prompt reflection and inquiry.
