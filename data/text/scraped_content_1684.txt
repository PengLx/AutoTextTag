To become better at understanding the people around you, start with these five dimensions.
Title: Extroversion Content: It reflects the degree to which people like to be the center of attention in social situations. Extroverts want that spotlight shown on them, while introverts shun the spotlight (though they typically have many friends and like engaging in smaller interactions).
Title: Agreeableness Content: It reflects how much people want others to like them and have difficulty delivering bad news, giving criticism, and standing up for themselves to others.People with agreeable personalities really want others to like them, while disagreeable people do not necessarily care whether others like them.
Title: Conscientiousness Content: Conscientious people are driven to complete the tasks they start and to follow rules.It is easy to undervalue the people low in conscientiousness, because they need a lot of supervision. However, those low in conscientiousness may try creative solutions to problems, because they do not feel the need to follow rules.
Title: Openness to experience Content: Openness reflects peopleâ€™s willingness to consider new ideas. People who are open will try new ideas on for size, while those closed to experience will typically reject new ideas just because they are new.
Title: Emotional stability Content: Emotionally stable individuals are stoic. They are unfazed by circumstances. Emotionally unstable individuals experience significant highs and lows in their lives. This instability can cause difficulties in the workplace when people get angry or upset at others.
