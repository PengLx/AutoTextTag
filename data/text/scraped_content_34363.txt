Title: True Love Content: When you eat a delicious fish and say: "I love that fish." Thats not Love. You don't love the fish, but how the fish makes you feel. True Love is just focused on the other person, regardless of one self. True Love isn't blind to the other's mistakes, nor trying to change them. But Loving the whole person.True Love fulfills, not only your partner, but also oneself. Only Jesus can give you True Love
