Title: Fear born out of practicality Content: We sometimes give in to fear disguised as practicality.Replace"I'd love to, but..." with"I'm going to, and...". The worst that can happen is most likely manageable and nowhere close to living with never having tried.
Title: The "good enough" narrative Content: Don't settle for good enough, for the " I hate my job but it makes great money, I provide for my family and I can save for retirement".Don't ignore the call for greatness, whatever greatness means to you.
Title: Quieting your curiosity Content: Don't de-prioritize your curiosity. Never be satisfied that you know enough.Grow to think of curiosity as a value, a virtue.
