Title: Be Water Content: Nothing is weaker than water, and in that weakness, there is immense strength. Water is fine and impossible to grasp. It does not suffer any hurt, and cannot be stabbed, or cut. It has no shape of its own but molds according to where it is placed. It can be hard as a rock and also invisible as vapor.Being like water, humble, adaptive, resilient and ever-changing, we become masters of our surroundings.
