Title: Implementation intention Content: You are 2x to 3x more likely to follow through with a habit if you make a specific plan for when, where, and how you are going to implement it. This is known as an implementation intention.You can use this formula: “During the next week, I will partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on [DAY] at [TIME OF DAY] at/in [PLACE].”
Title: Automaticity Content: This is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which allows the pattern to become automatic and habitual.Because when you begin practicing a new habit it requires a lot of conscious effort to remember to do it. But after a while,your new habit becomes a normal routine and the process is more or less mindless and automatic.
Title: Focusing on one thing Content: People who try to accomplish multiple goals are less committed and less likely to succeed than those who focus on a single goal.So it's important to remember thatdeveloping a specific plan for when, where, and how you will stick to a new habit will dramatically increase the odds that you will actually follow through, but only if you focus on one thing.
