Title: Acknowledge Your Emotions Content: Mentally strong people admit when they're embarrassed, sad, disappointed, or discouraged. They have confidence in their ability to deal with uncomfortable emotions head-on, which is essential to coping with their discomfort in a healthy manner.
Title: Rejection And Pushing Limits Content: For mentally strong people, rejection serves as proof that they're living life to the fullest. They expect to be rejected sometimes, and they're not afraid to go for it, even when they suspect it may be a long shot.If you never get rejected, you may be living too far inside your comfort zone.
Title: Treat Yourself With Compassion Content: Rather than think, "You're so stupid for thinking you could do that," mentally strong people treat themselves with compassion.They respond to negative self-talk with a kinder, more affirming message.
Title: Not Letting Rejection Define You Content: If one company turns mentally strong people down for a job, they don't declare themselves incompetent.They keep rejection in perspective.One person's opinion, or one single incident, should never define who you are.
Title: Learning From Rejection Content: Mentally strong people ask themselves, "What did I gain from this?" so they can learn from rejection. With each rejection, they grow stronger and become better.
