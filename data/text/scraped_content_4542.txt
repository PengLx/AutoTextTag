Title: Getting your team on board Content: The idea that we need everyone on board before taking action in the workplace prevents teams from shifting from 'discussion' to 'doing.''Doing' is often framed in terms of proving and performing. But if we frame 'doing' in terms of improving and learning, people will be less inclined to hold back and would be more comfortable to try something new.
Title: Commit to Actions Content: Trying to get people "on board" means trying to get people to align their actions and behaviors, as well as change their mindset. Aiming to change their mindsets adds a burden that will delay progress.It is better to simply commit actions. Don't try to convince dissenters and outliers that their thinking should change since the decision will still play out in the future. As long as they commit to the decision with their actions, it is enough.
