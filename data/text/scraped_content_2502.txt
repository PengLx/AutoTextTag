Title: Listen to Learn, Not to Be Polite Content: Listen from a place of curiosity, not generosity.True dialogue does not happen when we pretend to listen, and it certainly cannot happen if we are not listening at all.If you ever finish a conversation and learned nothing surprising, you werenâ€™t truly listening.
Title: Quiet Your Agenda Content: Really listen to what someone else is trying to say.We need information that is disconfirming, not confirming.
Title: Ask More Questions Content: Ask more questions than you give answers.When you ask questions, you create a safe space for other people to give you an unvarnished truth.
Title: Your Talk/Listen Ratio Content: Pay attention to your talk/listen ratio.Strive for a 2:1 ratio of listening to talking.
Title: Repeat Back What You Heard Content: Implement a process called active listening.Repeat back to the speaker what you heard.If the speaker agrees that what you heard is what he or she intended to say, you can move on. If not, the speaker needs to reword their statement until the listener really does understand.
Title: Wait until someone is done talking Content: Actually wait until someone is done talking before you respond.The most difficult component of listening effectively is waiting for a period at the end of a sentence before formulating a reply.
