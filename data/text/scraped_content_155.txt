Title: Use Habits to reduce decision fatigue Content: By building a habit, you avoid the decision entirelyand you can save your decision making energy for other important things.
Title: Use if/then thinking Content: For example, if someone constantly interrupts you, the rule might be: if the person interrupts me 2 times in a conversation, then I will say something.This technique can help streamline many typical, routine choices we face in our lives.
Title: Save time by not deliberating pointlessly Content: If the issues on the table have been reasonably vetted, the choices are equally attractive, and there is still no clear answer, then admit that there is no clearly identifiable right way to go and just decide.
