Title: Self-control is not fixed Content: Self-control is not a quality that remains stable throughout a person’s life, similar to IQ or personality.A person’s level of self-control tends to wax and to wane over the course of the day. Self-control is less like a mental capacity such as intelligence and more like a fluctuating resource such as physical energy.
Title: Why we fail at self-control Content: Factors such asnegative mood, fatigue and alcohol play a large part in self-control failure.Previous effort is one especially well studied factor that decreases self-control. All else being equal, a second self-control attempt after an initial one is more likely to fail than one that comes after a relatively restful period when no self-control was exercised.
Title: Understanding self-control Content: Self-control is indeed a resource, but a renewable, psychological one.Goals that are motivated from within—for reasons that are personally important to us—are more likely to succeed than those that are motivated from without.Succeeding at self-control is more about the desire rather than the ability to do so.
