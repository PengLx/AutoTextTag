Title: The Slowness Rage Content: Being passively angry while walking due to others being slower than you is a thing. It is called ‘Pedestrian Aggressiveness Syndrome’ and has many degrees of behaviour, each more violent than the other.Slowness rage is also found when one is driving, or when a web page is loading, or if the grocery line is, well, slow.
Title: Slow Life Is A Problem Content: Slow things are slowly driving us crazy. Society is now on a fast pace, and this has wrapped our sense of timing.The accelerating pace of society has set off a cycle, resetting our internal timers. Rage for others who are slow eventually sabotages our timers. This is a downward spiral, where will power doesn’t work, and can even be detrimental.
Title: Impatience: The New Virtue Content: Evolution has given us impatience. We are given the impulse to act, to choose, to abandon or to chase something else, in the limited time we have, instead of spending time in a single unrewarding or slow activity.Taking into account the speed of communication that is now 10 million times faster than before, and human movement, which is now 100 times faster, we can see society picking up speed and becoming increasingly impatient.
Title: Fast Everything Content: From Amazon to Mcdonalds, the need for speed is well known. Efficient services thrive in the modern age, where the french fries are timed to be ready in a few seconds for the ever-impatient consumer.Patience is no longer a virtue as these billion/trillion dollar companies have their entire business models on being fast.
Title: Being Present Content: Research shows that being in the present without the avalanche of thoughts, is the way out of this impatience cyclone. For those who cannot meditate, gratitude towards what we have works just as good.
