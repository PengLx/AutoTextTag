Title: Ketosis Content: Is a metabolic state. Think of being in or out of ketosis like the settings in a hybrid car; you can rely on gas or electricity to different degrees.In ketosis, we rely on fat instead of carbs for energy and do so to such an extent that we start making ketones from fat.
Title: The function of ketones Content: Ketones aren’t just a form of energy, they’re powerful signaling molecules. They regulate the expression of genes and dampen inflammatory processes.Your body is always producing a very low level of ketones, irrespective of your diet. You start producing more of them when following a diet that’s high in fat and low in carbs.
Title: Getting in ketosis Content: The stricter you restrict carbs (or total calories), the quicker you will be in ketosis.Restricting your carb intake to 20g per day is a good heuristic (loose rule) for entering ketosis. It will generally get you into ketosis within a few days.Fasting gets you into ketosis very quickly.

Title: 6 benefits of ketosis for medical conditions Content: Epilepsy. Keto has been proven to be very beneficial and highly successful in treating epilepsyMetabolic syndrome. Being in a state of nutritional ketosis helps to improve markers of metabolic disease.Alzheimer’s disease. Ketone bodies themselves have been shown to be neuroprotective, which bodes well as a potential treatment option or intervention for improving neurodegenerative diseases.Cancer.  Keto is part of the larger umbrella of metabolic therapies that show promise.Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS can be reversed if insulin levels are lowered. The ketogenic diet helps with weight loss and improving insulin sensitivity.Lou Gehrig’s disease (ALS). Keto has been proven effective in protecting nerve cells and their ability to produce energy. It has the potential to improve symptoms associated with ALS.
