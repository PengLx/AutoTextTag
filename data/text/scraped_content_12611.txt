Title: Carpe diem Content: One lesson everybody comes to learn sooner or later in life is that life ends, we all die. Through the death of a beloved one or just by hearing news on unknown people's death, this is the one topic that always stays stuck to our brain. However, being alive here and now does matter and a lot: therefore, try living your life through good and bad and enjoy it as much as you can, as you never know when everything is over.
Title: Change is inevitable Content: Change scares us, almost always: not knowing how a new chapter of our life will end up feeling like can really lead to feelings of distress. However, change brings out, most often, evolution. Embracing change can prove to be the best thing you have ever done, as growth is seldom possible without change.
Title: Change your attitude towards the current events Content: Whenever you face difficult times, be patient. Whenever you feel like following your passion, do it without regrets. Whenever you want something, work hard to get it. Whenever a change is inevitable, embrace. Learn to adjust your attitude according to what you go through in the different moments and do not forget to cherish the present moment. 
Title: Learn from the hard times Content: Going through hard times has two main consequences: firstly,  they change you fundamentally and, secondly, they enable you to grow. Learning how to live through hard times is one of the major keys to a successful and happy life. 
Title: Learn to be patient with yourself Content: When you do not know exactly where you are heading to, learn to be patient. Unplanned events often lead to pleasant surprises and personal growth. Learn to be open-minded and accept new challenges and your life might just turn out way better than expected.
