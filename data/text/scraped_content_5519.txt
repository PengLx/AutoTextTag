Love & Relationships,Communication
Title: Dating In The Pandemic Content: In these unprecedented and strange times, planning ahead seems impossible due to the uncertainty around and the doomsday scenarios in the news.Initiating and navigating a new relationship now has an extra (and not too small) obstacle of a virus threatening humanity across the planet.The ongoing pandemic has done the unthinkable: It has slowed us down, freezing time for a while. This affects our blossoming romances in ways not documented before.
Title: Lockdown In A New Relationship Content: Being in Lockdown or in a quarantine complicates dating in unexpected ways, raises some previously unheard questions (like who’s got a more ‘apocalypse’ friendly place) and makes partners feel as if they are already in the boring part of a relationship without any of the initial romance or spark.
Title: Love During Quarantine Content: Constantly sharing updates about the pandemic with your new partner is not a good idea.Social distancing etiquette (hello elbow bumps) may feel awkward, and FaceTime video chats can feel a bit too intimate and over-the-top after a while, as the other person is still a practical stranger.
Title: Apartment Date Content: If meeting in person, like a dinner date in an apartment, do not discuss anything about the virus.Provide yourself and your partner space to know each other, having deep conversations with soothing music. The news can wait.
