Title: Habit Ladder Content: This is a system that is automated by you. Itis called a habit ladder because, from the time you wake up to finishing your first work task of the day, you're climbing up one rung at a time. Each new step is reached because of the last.
Title: How Habits Work Content: A habit - a mini-system that once you create, becomes automatic to your body, with minimal interference from the brain.The Habit Loop is a breakdown of a habit put it into three sections:Cue: A certain trigger that awakens the habitRoutine: The action you perform without thinking.Reward: The change you experience making you want to do more of the same.
Title: Making a Habit Ladder Content: Keep a trigger cue ready and stack up the routine in such a way that your tasks become a habitual routine without any friction, each trigger cue and routine stacked over the next one.Example: Put on running shoes instead of slippers in the morning and that's your cue to go out for a walk, then when you are back and feeling sweaty, that's your cue to take a bath.
