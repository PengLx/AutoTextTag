Title: Scheduling Calls Content: Never schedule a call or meeting using email. Right now, the usual hallway conversations or impromptu office visits are impossible, so try to use meeting scheduling services that allow people to select a time from your list of available times.Use specific meeting features of Microsoft Outlook or use Apps/plugins like Calend.ly or Acuity.
Title: Organizing your Obligations Content: Immediately move obligations out of your inbox and into role-specific archives.Moving and prioritizing things into specific compartments or zones helps us organize our thought process and workflow. It also helps us focus and does not let different kinds of activity(of our many different roles) overwhelm us.
Title: Working Only In Office Hours Content: Having fixed working hours (while at home in your pajamas) makes you concentrate better, and be more productive. You need to switch off from work once the office hours are over.
