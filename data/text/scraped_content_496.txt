Title: Sleep and Alzheimer’s disease Content: During sleep, a sewage system in the brain, called the glymphatic system, kicks into high gear. As you enter deep sleep, this sanitization system cleanses the brain of a sticky, toxic protein linked to Alzheimer’s, known as beta-amyloid.Without sufficient sleep, you fail to get that power cleanse. With each passing night of insufficient sleep, that Alzheimer’s disease risk escalates, like compounding interest on a loan.
Title: Insufficient sleep and weight gain Content: Poor sleeping swells concentrations of a hormone that makes you feel hungry while suppressing a companion hormone that otherwise signals food satisfaction. Despite being full, you will still want to eat more.And if you try to diet but don’t get enough sleep while doing so, it is futile, since up to 70% of the weight you lose will come from lean body mass, not fat.
Title: Sleeping less than 6 hours Content: Routinely sleeping less than six hours a night also compromises your immune system, significantly increasing your risk of cancer.So much so, that recently the World Health Organization classified any form of night-time shiftwork as a probable carcinogen.
