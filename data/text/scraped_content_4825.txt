Title: We Are Born Creative Content: Human beings are born with a capacity to reflect, evaluate, to come up with new ideas, and find new connections. We think such creative abilities are for a chosen few, but we all have it. We may have unintentionally squashed them from our lives due to our education systems.We ultimately don't feel creative as our routines aren't conducive to it. 
Title: Decades of Wrong Beliefs Content: Productivity requires continuous output, while creativity is a non-linear, messy, disjointed process that needs to be unstructured.We have decades of exposure to historical and cultural beliefs on how work should be and what it means to be successful, so it is hard for us to understand creativity.
Title: Ignite The Fire Content: To be creative, we have let our brains loose. The mind needs rest and time every day to daydream, imagine and get intentionally bored. Letting our minds free is an incredibly important cognitive exercise.Take the time to expose yourself in diverse subjects, things that inspire you and dissolve boundaries can foster creativity.Identify and let go of wrong beliefs and outdated stories you tell yourself every day.
