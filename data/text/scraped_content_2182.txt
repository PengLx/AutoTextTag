Title: The “one-minute rule” Content: With this rule, you do anything that presents itself, right away, as long as you can do it in a minute: Hang up your coat, read a letter and toss it, fill in a form, answer an email, note down a citation, put a dish in the dishwasher, etc.Because the tasks are so quick, it isn’t too hard to make yourself follow the rule, but it has big results. Keeping all those small, nagging tasks under control makes you more serene, less overwhelmed.
