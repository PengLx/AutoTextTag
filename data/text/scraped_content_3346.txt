Title: Open-ended questions Content: Avoid questions you can answer “yes” or “no”. They are closed-ended, don’t generate discussion and they rarely yield any insight.By asking open-ended questions, you get far more interesting insights. They invite reflection and start discussions.
Title: Challenge assumptions Content: Every decision is based on assumptions. If you don’t understand these assumptions, you may make a bad decision.It’s often helpful to ask yourself first, and then your colleagues, “What are we assuming in this scenario?”
Title: Get both sides of the story Content: It is so easy to hear one side of the story, act on the information, and then be embarrassed when you find out that you only had half the facts.Always remember that there are at least 2 sides to every story.
Title: Ask follow-up questions Content: Avoid the temptation to comment on every question. Often you don’t get to the real meat of an issue until you’ve gone several questions deep.This will make your comments or decisions much more informed.
Title: Get comfortable with silence Content: Don't get uncomfortable when things get quiet. You don't have to fill the space with chatter.You can let this work to your advantage by just keeping your lips locked and your ears open.
Title: Help people Content: One of the best ways to mentor others is to ask rather than tell. By doing this, you help people discover their own insights.A good question to ask is: "What can we learn from this experience that might be useful to us in the future?”
Title: Facts vs speculation Content: Make sure you tell people what you know and what you think you know and make sure they know the difference.
