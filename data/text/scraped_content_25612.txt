After the product comes to the end of its life, it is thrown away. If this model is not replaced, the world will reach a point where it will lose the capacity to sustain itself.
Title: Circular economy Content: The purpose of circular economy is to prevent waste while promoting sustainable economic growth. Manufacturers have to design reusable products. The model follows the production-use-recycling-production cycle.The circular economy is more profitable and less harmful to the environment.
