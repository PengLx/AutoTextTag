Title: A Solution Not Understood Content: When we encounter a problem we cannot understand, our first reaction is to find the answers. A common occurrence in the coding world is that answers to problems are not understood even after they are found out.The way to overcome this situation is to find it using trial and error, and if that fails, to ask someone who may know it.
Title: The Recursive Filter Content: While trying to understand the solution given to us, diving deep into the mechanics and the flow chart of the problem helps us map the problem and refactor and optimize the solution.This recurring filter that is used when each component is tinkered with is the recursive approach to problem-solving while having the added benefit of deeper learning.
