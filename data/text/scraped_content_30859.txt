Title: Intelligence Is The Ability To Change Content: If you have never changed your mind about some fundamental belief or assumption that was held in your mind for years or decades, or if you have never questioned the basics, then you may be ignorant. Every process of transformation begins with a change of the mind.Life is a series of changes, cycles, rhythms, seasons and systems, flowing like a river. Even your body is changing without your consent, and you can only accept the fact.
Title: Set The Process Of Transformation Content: Change is the only wave in the ocean which you can surf and take control of.If we live life without evolving, changing or upgrading ourselves, not becoming a completely new, refined person every few months or years, then we are stuck being average and not making the most of our strengths, not participating in the great process of transformation that life is inviting us into.
Title: Our Habits And Routines Content: Most people do not make any room in their lives to accommodate better, smarter, faster processes and habits in order to automate their repetitive tasks, freeing up mental bandwidth to indulge in creative pursuits that broaden their minds.If we still rely on the same mental models and principles that worked five years ago, then we are not really evolving.Our ability to change as the months and years go by is the only thing that can help us survive, thrive and evolve.
Title: Intellectual Growth in Small Increments Content: Human beings grow and evolve naturally, based on our ability to change, and the knowledge we ‘download’ from our surroundings. Being in a growth or a change mode keeps us out of our comfort zones and in the learning zone.The learnings and changes need not be radical, and even small, incremental changes in our habits and behaviours will significantly improve our life.
