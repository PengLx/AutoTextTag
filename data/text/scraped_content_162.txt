Title: Stress and decision making Content: Much of the stress in life comes from making decisions. You feel good to make the right decisions. But whether a decision was the right one or not, life goes on. If it was a good one, wonderful. If it was the wrong one, you can count it as experience. 
Title: There's no right choice Content: Choices can be well reasoned or poorly reasoned. Their consequences can be beneficial or bad, but there's no right choice, just a wide range of possibilities and for each, an endless web of consequences.
Title: Informed choices vs. Right choices Content: More data won't necessarily lead you to the right choice. There’s a big difference between trying to make smart, well-informed choices and trying to make the right choices. More information might be helpful, but there’s no guarantee.
Title: Getting it right is impossible Content: And realizing that is truly a relief. Giving up on the idea of right decisions doesn’t mean giving up on using our best judgment. But much more important than any decision is the motivation behind the sorts of decisions you tend to make and the principles you stick to.
