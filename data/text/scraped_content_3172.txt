Title: Excuses Breed More Failure Content: When you are disappointed, you havetwo choices on how to respond: You can find out how you could have done it differently, or you can tell yourself that you were not at fault.Shifting the blame has a negative cascading effect on how you behave in the future.
Title: Personal Responsibility Breeds Success Content: Making excuses allows you to externalize your failures and blame something else. It also demotivates you when you feel the outcomes in your life are out of your control.Taking up responsibility does the opposite: It leads to introspection where you can analyze what you could have done differently. It will motivate you to work better and harder.
Title: How To Stop Making Excuses Content: It all comes down to the stories you tell yourself when you feel overwhelmed or fail.If you work too much and don’t have time for fun, do you tell yourself that people demand too much from you? Or, do you tell yourself you don’t prioritize your own time well enough?In one story you are in control, and the other you are not. Focus on the story you can control.
