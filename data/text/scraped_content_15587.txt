Title: The functions of art Content: Art has a few amazing functions and works as a distinct negotiating capability between individuals (including those who have never met and still have the power enhance each other’s lives). Art also has the power to create and foster intimacy, to heal wounds, and to emphasize that not all wounds need to be healed and not all scars are ugly.
Title: Finding inspiration in loneliness Content: When we face loneliness in our lives, we should not always rush to overcome it by surrounding ourselves with people.   We ca embrace our loneliness by turning to the art of others who felt the same feeling of loneliness as we do and find inspiration in their art. We can use them to move forward with our own creative pursuits which can help us work through difficult, and lonely, times.
