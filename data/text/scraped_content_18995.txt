Title: Smartphones: A Memory Replacement Content: The smartphone has partially replaced our memory, helping us recall information like birthdays, deadlines, contact details and to-do lists. These are the things we relied on our memory for, but now instead of training our memory, we are training it to rely on the external tools and apps.As we rely on our smartphones, we are getting increasingly forgetful, which is not good for any successful business or personal relationship, where you need to show that you value and remember them.
Title: How Your Mind Registers Information Content: To use your memory, you need to figure out how your mind registers information. It can be in writing or audio/visual format. Itâ€™s important to leave technology behind and focus on the individual or group in front of you.When we get introduced to someone or meet them for the first time, repeat their name often in your conversation.Do not hide behind your laptop taking notes during a meeting.Make it a game to remember people's names as you walk by the office.
Title: What We Avoid Doing Might Help Us Content: The boring, routine work that is often delegated to others is a memory-enhancing goldmine.Repetitive tasks like organizing information, digitizing an old contact list, inputting information manually on a laptop or PC, which leaders would normally delegate to others, can aid us in recalling information and memory consolidation.
Title: New Information Content: Though it sounds counterintuitive, prioritizing new information instead of important information helps us recall better. Example: Looking up or googling the people that you meet online helps us retain their names and other details.Prioritize remembering what is in front of you and in the current context.
