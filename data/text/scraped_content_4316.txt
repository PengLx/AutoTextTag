Title: Design creates Desirability Content: The No. 1 reason startups fail is that they try to build something that nobody wants.People adopt and endorse something which they feel they want at a primal level, with the design appeal of the product/service coming in play.
Title: The Three Forces Content: Creating something that people would desire requires examining the three main forces involved.The Person: The kind of person the product or service is targeted towards, his likes and dislikes, age, and preferences.The Situation: The current situation, climate, mindset or even the state of the world is a big factor. People require different things in different situations.The Problem: The problem part is the force which makes the person take action. It is the trigger for the person to find a solution.The solution to the problem may not become your product or service automatically, but it can be a process to move towards the best kind of solution.
