Title: Swinging Our Arms While Walking
 Content: Scientists have been long bothered about the reason we swing our arms while walking and have even speculated that it is some evolutionary error.New research shows that our natural swinging of arms is making our legs work better and spend less energy, and the body would have adverse effects if kept still. The natural arm swinging balances our body's weight that is displaced by walking(or running) and as a result, we consume 12 percent less metabolic energy, while taking care of the spine.Walking by artificially swinging your arms in a reverse sync leads to 26 percent more energy consumption.
