Title: Humans are wired to worry Content: As it turns out. Our brains are continually imagining futures that will meet our needs and things that could stand in the way of them. And sometimes any of those needs may be in conflict with each other.Worry is when that vital planning gets the better of us and occupies our attention to no good effect.
Title: The mind always needs something Content: We worry because our pre-conditioned mind cannot be left alone.Like a motor that cannot be switched off, the mind keeps running, performing background thinking at all times.Studies show people would rather prefer to be electrocuted with mild electric shocks than to just sit in a room doing nothing.
Title: Mindfulness Content: Mindfulness is a practice of observing our mind's activity and is the antidote to worry.Mindfulness results in increased attention, better working memory, and an awareness of mind while enriching the neural connections of the brain.
Title: Applying mindfulness Content: Yoga and Tai Chi, are other examples of applying mindfulness in your present moment.Other systems like Cognitive Therapy, Self-Compassion, prayer, and visualization are techniques to replace negative imagination with good thoughts.
