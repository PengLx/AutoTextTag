Title: Organic junk food is still junk food Content: From a macronutrient perspective, organic junk foods are often identical to their conventional counterparts.They tend to be equally high in sugar and low in protein and fiber, which makes food less satiating and more likely to cause health problems long term.
Title: Organic isn't always healthy Content: Many organic brands tend to cater to a health-conscious crowd, meaning they’ll often use less processing or healthier ingredients to appeal to their consumers. But the organic label alone does not guarantee this.
Title: The “health halo” effect Content: It refers to a scientifically researched phenomenon in which certain claims, such as “low fat” or “made with organic ingredients” can lead us to assume a food is healthier or lower in calories.
Title: Checking the labels Content: In general, a lengthy list of ingredients means a food’s been highly processed, especially if it contains refined sweeteners or additives like soy lecithin, glycerin or guar gum.Manufacturers can use synthetic fibers or other nutrients to boost their nutrition label, the ingredient list can better clue us in.
