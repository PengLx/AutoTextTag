Title: The real focus Content: Really focussing on the core business is the most important requirement for startup success. Becoming an expert at fundraising should not be necessary.Companies rarely fail because they didn't raise money - they fail because they didn't build something people wanted.
Title: Tactics are an optimization Content: Tactics should not be ignored. However, a business isn't going to fail because it had poor tactics. A business with a great product will do fine with common tactics.A successful business will have both great products and tactics. But it's 80/20, where the fundamentals of building something great is 80% and the tactics and metrics that drive another 20%.
