Title: Deciding to see a therapist Content: You don’t need to have a specific diagnosis to benefit from therapy.Most of us have some aspects of our lives we would like to improve: relationships that are in need of some rehab or some habits or behaviors that we would like to shift or change.
Title: Going through a big change Content: Change, even if it’s positive, can lead to emotional and physical stress: you find yourself in a situation where you don’t know what to expect and that leads to confusion.A professional can help you through a situation that feels insurmountable.
Title: Repeating unhealthy patterns Content: Everyone makes missteps and occasionally slips into risky behaviors.But when you can’t stop a specific behavior, if it’s interfering with your ability to function properly in your daily life, or it’s negatively affecting your relationships, it’s time to pause and seek help.
Title: Affected by past trauma Content: There’s no single way to get over past trauma, but if you can’t stop thinking about your trauma, or you’re isolating yourself because of fear it will happen again, there are ways to cope.
Title: Facing big decisions Content: Sometimes, in the face of big decisions, your family and friends won't give you the best perspective, because they are too invested to be objective.A good therapist won’t make the choice for you -they will work with you so that you can figure out the right answer for yourself.
Title: Dealing with relationships Content: A therapist can help you either strengthen or leave a bad relationship and can help with coping techniques if it ends.Couples therapy can also be a good way to maintain a happy relationship. You don’t need to be in crisis to seek out a therapist who can help you ensure you’re communicating effectively.
Title: Physical and mental health Content: In situations where your physical well-being is tied to your mental state — for things like insomnia, weight loss, dealing with chronic pain and so on — therapy can help.
