Title: The faulty logic Content: We usually consider moving into marriage in an attempt to preserve and prolong the happy romantic feelings that characterize the early stages of almost all relationships.But in most cases, there is no real connection between those feelings and the institution of marriage: marriage tends to move us onto a more administrative plane.
Title: Unrealistic expectations Content: The gap between expectation and reality is the cause for many of lifeâ€™s disappointments.We like to create detailed fantasies of how our lives are going to be. But when we expect our reality to match a fantasy but life turns out nothing like it, we feel disappointed.
Title: Asking the right questions Content: "Are you the right person for me?" is the wrong question to ask, because nothing outside of ourselves can fix us or bring us happiness.A more constructive question to ask would be "Can I accommodate your imperfections with humor and grace?"
