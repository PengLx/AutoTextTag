Title: How to change careers Content: Do an assessment. Make a list of your strengths, weaknesses, what you like and hate to do. Look outside and ask what industry lines up with the things you wrote under strengths and likes.Avoid dwelling on the past. Take what you’ve learned and move it to an industry that’s going to suit you better.Jumping ship isn’t always the answer.Walking away from an unfulfilling career isn’t always an option, especially for those who can’t afford the financial consequences of making a switch.Don’t react too quickly. Know the kind of person you are and the kind of job you would enjoy before you can look out at the universe of jobs that are out there and make the move.
