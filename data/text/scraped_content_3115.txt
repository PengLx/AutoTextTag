Title: Constructive Criticism Content: It's often the only way we learn about our weaknesses and without it, we can’t improve. When we’re defensive, we run the risk of missing out on this important insight.Feedback’s not easy to give and it’s certainly not easy to receive, but it’ll help us now and in the long run.
Title: Stop Your First Reaction Content: At the first sign of criticism, before you do anything—stop. Try not to react at all.Even a few seconds are enough for your brain to process a situation: you can halt a dismissive facial expression or reactive quip and remind yourself to stay calm.
Title: Remember the Benefits of Getting Feedback Content: Namely,to improve your skills, work product, and relationships, and to help you meet the expectations that your manager and others have of you.Also, try to cut back any reaction you're having to the person who is delivering the feedback, even if it's hard to receive criticism from someone you don't fully respect.
Title: Listen for Understanding Content: As the person shares feedback with you, listen closely. Allow the person to share their complete thoughts, without interruption. When they’re done, repeat back what you heard.Avoid analyzing or questioning the person’s assessment; instead, just focus on understanding his or her comments and perspective.
Title: Deconstruct the Feedback Content: Ask questions to get to the root of the actual issues being raised and possible solutions for addressing them:Seek specific examples to help you understand the issue.Try to understand whether this is an isolated issue.Look for concrete solutions to address the feedback.
