Writing it allows you to slow down and see the absurdity in your own negative self-talk.
Title: Treat Yourself Like A Friend Content: If you catch yourself on a self-deprecating rant, check in with yourself and ask, “Would I say this to _____? ” If the answer is “no, ” then you don’t deserve to be spoken to in that way either. Don’t let these insults pass without defending yourself against your own negative self-talk.
