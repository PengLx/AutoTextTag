Title: Sleep or nap Content: If you couldn’t be bothered with “recharging” activities, go and take a nap instead. You can’t go wrong with that.If you don’t have a comfortable place to lie down – sit up straight, close your eyes and breathe gently instead.
Title: Stand and walk around more Content: If you work at a desk like most people, have the habit of changing positions (preferably when moving to the next task).Get a small desk suitable for laptop use on beds and place it on your work desk. Stand up and use your laptop that way.
Title: Meditate Content: If you don’t have the patience to go through 15 minutes of guided meditation, try this:Close your eyes, be mindful of your breathing and all the while keeping your mind as empty as possible and thinking of a two-syllabi-word. If you are tired, just keep your mind blank instead.
Title: Drink water (or tea) Content: Keeping ourselves high hydrated is key to revitalizing our bodies and making sure we have ample energy when we need it.If you find water too tasteless, opt for tea instead. Try it without sugar and drink it as is.
Title: Exercise Content: Exercise has been identified as a keystone habit (a habit that changes other habits automatically).If you are short on time and you can’t do the typical 30-45 minute gym or jogging session, try out Tabata instead. It’s a 4-minute long bodyweight routine.
Title: Practice gratitude Content: Research is showing that being productive doesn’t bring happiness but that happiness brings productivity.Practice smiling and soon enough you will be happier.Try to think about just 3 things you are grateful for.
