Title: Toxic People Content: Toxic people spread negativity and suffocate the positive. Left unchecked, they can destroy and exhaust.Step away from them or make sure policies and supervision are in place to minimize their damage.
Title: Lack Of Professional Development Content: Most want to grow and learn, else they feel the workplace is static and dull. Professional development for employees lets them grow in their careers and know that the organization and you are invested in their success.
Title: Lack Of Vision Content: A clearly communicated vision sets the direction and lets people know where to focus. Without it, even the best employees are less effective, because it's hard to excel if you don't understand the big picture.
Title: Wasted Time Content: Unnecessary meetings and emails leave workers frustrated. Show people you value them by showing them you value their time.
Title: Inadequate Communication Content: Poor communication leads to frequent second-guessing, ignored tasks, duplicated jobs, lack of information, and destructive rumors. A clear flow of communication benefits everyone.
Title: Vertical Management Content: Workers who feel unheard or are forced to follow without question tend to not do more than a grudging minimum. The more collaboration, the more investment and the more motivation.
Title: Lack Of Appreciation Content: People grow uninspired and apathetic when hard work or extraordinary results go unrecognized. A simple thank you will ameliorate that.
Title: Bad Leadership Content: Bad leaders harm individuals, teams and the organization. To improve your workplace, develop your own leadership, then hire and grow the best leaders at every level.
