Title: Machine Learning - How? What? and Why?  Content: “Machine Learning” , a term came out of nowhere is now the most trending one. Though, one might not know what is it actually? People are bound to many examples, but the exact idea seems to be different. People often mix up the terms Data Science, Machine Learning andArtificial Intelligence . These are different branches of study but one is related to each other and successive of one another. Machine Learning algorithms are fed with huge amount of data known as Sample Data . Before feeding the data, the data must be cleaned and should be properly formatted. This process is known as Data Pre-processing . A Machine Learning Model can never make 100% accurate predictions otherwise there is no point of training the Model.
