Title: The unfamiliar Content: One of the things to observe about children is how everything on earth is new to them, exciting and worthy of examination. Nothing is taken for granted. In a more limited way, we know from our experiences of traveling how much strange places and unfamiliar scenes will stimulate our curiosity. 
Title: A fresh view Content: Artists are a group that insists on being amazed. They cannot forget how surprising, beautiful and worthy of examination everything is.Albert DÃ¼rer, at the age of thirty-five years, looked at hands as though he had never seen any before, appreciating how fingers interlace, how foldable they are, in what varied shapes and textures they come in, how different the skin is on a thumb compared to an index finger.
Title: Boredom and curiosity Content: All significant scientific discoveries and works of art have been made by people who looked at things with the naivety of children. Conversely, boredom is the result of older humans allowing habit to get in the way of astonishment.
Title: We stop being curious Content: In the area of curiosity, we should all become attentive like children.The problem is that the questions tend to come far too fast, there is too much curiosity that is at odds with what we're trying to get done, so we end up wishing for less curiosity and desire some apathy instead.
Title: Return to first principles Content: Every new baby provides us with a chance to return and rethink everything from the ground up. We should allow and encourage the child to ask questions and wonder at the world. A child's greatest gift to us is to keep insisting that we look at the world anew.
