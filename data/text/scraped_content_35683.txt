Title: Normalize talking about Mental Health  Content: Often times we look at each other and judge based off of our character. We also compare ourselves to someone else. We have conversations about how we look,but can never normalize talking about Mental Health. When I look at the world and see how little they talk about it,I'm just wondering if we really are a people. We look at the homeless and say they're mad. We look at the psychiatric patient and we say they're mad. Any negative thought that comes to our mind about these people we say it boldly. But never evaluate our own actions?Let us move forward and normalize helping one another,caring for each others health and wellness: rather than judge how they behave and say negative words. The more you know and understand, the less you judge.
