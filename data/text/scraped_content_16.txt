Title: Because we idealize love, we overestimate it Content: Wesee it as a cure for all of life’s problems. And when we believe that all we need is love, we’re more likely to ignore fundamental values such as respect and commitment towards the people we care about. - Mark Manson
Title: Idealizing love=unrealistic expectations Content: ....about what love actually is and what it can do for us. These unrealistic expectations then sabotage the very relationships we hold dear in the first place. - Mark Manson
Title: Love doesn't equal compatibility Content: Falling in love with someone doesn’t necessarily mean they’re a good partner for you. Love is an emotional process; compatibility is a logical process. And the two don’t bleed into one another very well.
Title: Love is not special Content: But your self-respect is. So is your dignity. So is your ability to trust.Yes, you need more in life than love.Love is necessary. Love is beautiful. But love is not enough.
