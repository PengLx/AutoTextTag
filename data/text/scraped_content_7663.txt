Title: A clear mind Content: Running never fails to clear your head. Do you have to make a potentially life-altering decision? Go for a run. Are you feeling mad or sad? Go for a run.A run can sometimes make you feel like a brand-new person. Research in neuroscience found a link between aerobic exercise and subsequent cognitive clarity.
Title: Exercise and improved memory Content: Neuroscience used to think that our brains got a set amount of neurons. However, studies in animal models show that new neurons are produced in the brain throughout the lifespan. Vigorous aerobic exercise  - about 30 to 40 minutes - is the only activity that triggers the birth of those new neurons. The new neurons are created in the region of the brain associated with learning and memory, partially explaining the link between aerobic exercise and improvement in memory. 
Title: The brain’s frontal lobe Content: Increased activity is seen in the brain’s frontal lobe after adopting a long-term habit of physical activity. After about 30 - 40 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise, studies have recorded increased blood flow in this region, which is associated with clear thinking: planning ahead, focus and concentration, goal-setting, time management.This area is also linked to emotion regulation, allowing us to recover faster from emotions.
Title: Mindlessness Content: Mindlessness - daydreaming, or getting lost in your own thoughts - is as important as mindfulness. The mind wanders because it produces a reward when measured against goals and aspirations that are personally meaningful. Just because the benefits of losing yourself in your own thoughts are not easily measured doesn't mean they're not of value.
