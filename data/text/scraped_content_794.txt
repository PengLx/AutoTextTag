Title: Hire the right people Content: Design your hiring process with remote candidates in mind. Look for 3 main things:A strong skill set relevant to their jobs:you need to feel confident that they can complete basic job tasks independently.A candidate with an affinity for remote work.Hire candidates who share your company’s values: they’ll fit in faster if they share your cultural code.
Title: Put extra effort into onboarding Content: Remote workers won’t have the opportunity to be involved in spontaneous conversations or team lunches, but there are other things you can do to help them settle:provide info with new job critical stuff:team member introductions (personal bios, photos, advice for new employees), HR training links, task checklists, long-term goals, and more. assign mentors to new hires,who schedule regular video check-ins, make themselves available on Slack and make new employees feel welcome.
Title: Default working setups Content: Remote workers need a dedicated, quiet space to do their work, so it’s important to set some guidelines:encourage workers to join coworking spaces;encourage workers to set a dedicated insolated space at home for work, with suitable furniture;fast reliable internet access;They can still work from a coffee shop every once in a while, but they need a good default setup.
Title: Make time for face-to-face interactions Content: Look for ways to build strong relationships:use video calls: team communication tools lack fundamental human elements like body language and tone;host team retreats:you’re saving money by not renting physical offices, so why not funnel that money into team bonding.
Title: Trust your team to do the work Content: ... but check in from time to time.Watch how the project unfolds in tools like Trello, Confluence, and Slack. That way, you're not bugging direct reports for status updates, but you still understand what's happening.
