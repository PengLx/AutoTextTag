Title: Close friendship Content: To be best friends, you are committed to always be on standby. It's not that hard to be there for someone when you can physically be there, but when you're separated by state or time zone, you have to figure out a new way to be close.
Title: Keep creating shared experiences Content: When you see a friend regularly, you develop a collection of shared memories. You will also have an intimate understanding of what they're up to generally. If you're separated long-term, those experiences will shrink.It's important to create something you share with the other individual, not just exchanging information about past experiences.The more opportunities you give yourself to connect, the more organically you'll get to know your friend's new life.
Title: It's going to take more effort Content: The idea that you can sustain a friendship and pick up right where you left off after long stretches of silence is a myth. A relationship grows stronger through nurturing.Although long-distance hacks can work for a time, there's no replacement for in-person interaction. It's more expensive and more of a hassle, but it's the best way to recharge a long-distance friendship.
Title: Treat it like a long-distance romance Content: The pain of seeing your friend leave helps to reinforce how much they mean to you.  It can be helpful to talk about your hopes or expectations about how often you'll talk, or when you'll see each other. Talk about the value of your friendship.
