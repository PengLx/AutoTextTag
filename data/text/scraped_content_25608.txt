Title: Curiosity declines with age Content: Children are extremely curious. They keep asking, "why?" and explore new things just because they want to know.But research shows that during the schooling years, curiosity steadily declines, and as adults, we fall into fixed and convenient thought patterns.
Title: The mechanics of curiosity Content: Research around curiosity found that children at age 5 scored 98% on a creativity test. When the same children took the test at age 10, only 30% scored well on the test. By age 15, only 12% of the same children did well. Less than 2% of adults are defined as creative based on their answer to this standardised test.Science suggests this decrease in curiosity could be caused when we feel there's no gap between what we know and what we want to know, so we just stop being curious.
Title: Benefits of curiosity Content: Curiosity keeps you young. Those that maintain a sense of wonder throughout life live longer.Curiosity helps you learn.

Title: How to cultivate curiosity Content: Ask questions: Randomly ask yourself why? and how?Read outside your field of interest.Be interested in people. Choose someone you haven't seen in a while, and invite them for coffee. Make it a goal to learn as much as possible about their interests.Practice talking less and listening more.Immerse yourself in a topic. Read lots of articles, books, and research papers.Write about this topic. Carry a notebook. It will make it easier to remember topics you are curious about.Learn about yourself. Explore your feelings, your goals, and even your family history.Slow down. Let your mind wander and allow questions to form.Hang out with a child, as this is one of the best reminders of our potential for curiosity.
