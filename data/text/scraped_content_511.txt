Meditation,Mindfulness
Title: Commercialization of spirituality Content: It's best to avoid the commercialization of contemplation if you want an authentic experience of meditation. Meditation has left the ashrams and become a fixture in the boardroom and livings rooms everywhere. Unfortunately, as spiritual practices enter into the wide marketplace of ideas, there is a tendency for them to be degraded and repackaged into self-improvement drivel and self-serving nonsense.
Title: Purpose of meditation Content: Meditative practice has no motive, except to experience the present moment. Simple as that.Meditation practiced for this reason transcends everything else.You can throw in the process all sorts of mantras and breathing techniques you can. But the point still stands, to meditate is to be in the now.
