Title: Thinking about the end of our lives Content: Death is a timeless subject: no matter what is currently happening, death is constantly present in our mind: whether for fear of not losing someone we love or for fear of not dying ourselves. However, people tend to think more about this topic whenever tragic events happen in their lives or when the worldwide situation gets scarier overall.
Title: Remember death so you can cherish life Content: From Moses to Tolstov, our ancestors used to be very much focused on the subject of death.This is mostly because understanding death means actually understanding life: in order to make the most of our time spent on earth, we must not forget that we will all eventually die.
Title: Memento mori art Content: The fact of cherishing the present time and of making the most of what we still have left to live should be the motto of our lives. The truth is that death does not wait for us to be ready to go, it does not ask and it does not care. So, while you are still here, you might as well enjoy your life as much as you can.
