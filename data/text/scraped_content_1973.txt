Title: Schedule Time To Worry Content: Set aside 30 minutes each day to worry and make it consistent. Then, whenever you catch yourself worrying outside of that time frame, remember that the time to worry is later.Worrying can be an endless activity and putting a timeframe on it helps to contain it and shift it from rumination to problem solving.
