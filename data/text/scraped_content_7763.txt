Title: The circular path Content: ... when you're trying to improve something look like this:You start with some ideas.You get excited for a while (1-2 weeks).Maybe you take some steps and do something to act on your ideas.Your enthusiasm starts to fade and your projects get abandoned.You go back to where you started.
Title: The staircase path Content: ... when you're trying to improve something looks like this:You get an idea.You build a specific project around it (short-term).Once you finish it, you move to the next idea and the project around itEach project builds on the last, expanding options.
Title: What defines the shape of your path Content: Focusing on one thing at a time until you finish it: if you focus on one project at a time until completion, you will make infinitely more progress than the person who does multiple projects at once.Having the right method: doing something that’s outside your usual routine requires not just commitment, but new methods.  Actualization vs. possibility: the more you can adjust your life to the joys of doing and actualizing, over daydreaming and philosophizing, the more solid your life’s foundation will become.
