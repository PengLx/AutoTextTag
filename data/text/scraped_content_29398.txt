Title: Macronutrient Dieting Content: If It Fits Your Macros (IIFYM) is a new diet that counts the daily macronutrients in the food and drinks we intake, mainly the fats, carbs and proteins. It provides flexibility and choice in our diet with the same results as a much stricter diet.This popular new diet currently has no scientific research to test its effectiveness as compared to the previous diet plans of low-carb or low-fat consumption.
Title: Counting Calories Vs Counting Macros Content: Calorie counting does not take into account the type of nutrients consumed, reducing the many types of food into numbers. It essentially makes no distinction between cottage cheese and a chocolate bar, apart from the number of calories they have.The advantage of counting the macros (fats, proteins and carbs) is that many essential nutrients (vitamins, minerals) are naturally incorporated in our food intake.
