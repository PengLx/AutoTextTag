Title: The Self-Perception of Experts Content: New research on the accuracy of future predictions by people has some interesting findings:Experts, largely considered an authority, fared poorly than the novices, due to their overestimating their abilities, something known as the Dunning Kruger Effect.People who considered themselves more experienced or educated turned out to be closed-minded and more unlikely to learn from others, leading to a myopic or distorted view of the world around them.
Title: Facing Change: Millennials Vs Boomers Content: Past experience, which many experts think helps them to better understand the world, surprisingly does not improve the ability to predict the future. The research data showed accuracy levels of the younger generation (25 to 35 years of age) being the highest.Old people are slower to comprehend change, faster to believe and share fake news and less likely to be objective.
Title: Humility Content: Working with an open mind, ready to dive into unfamiliar territory and learning new things, makes the entire exercise stress-free and rewarding experience. This state of mind, along with basic humility makes for better performance. Oneâ€™s arrogance, ego and past can negatively affect the prediction quality.A humble attitude also makes people listen to others opinions and share their own unique insights, helping collaboration and constructive teamwork.
Title: Disagreements Are Good Content: While we talk to people we disagree with, without getting personal, we tend to learn new insights and ways of thinking.In contrast, if we only expose ourselves to people who think like us and share our worldview, we start living in an echo chamber, away from reality.
