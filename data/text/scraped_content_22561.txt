Title: Why We Avoid Asking For Advice Content: Most people shy away from asking for advice when they cannot figure out how to finish a tricky task or assignment at work.Reasons range from not wanting to bother anyone, or not trusting them for the solution that might be provided. There is also a misconception that others will think less of the person asking for advice. Advice seekers have a false psychological fear that the person whom they ask will refuse and embarrass them. Research proved that this is deeply unfounded and we grossly underestimate how helpful and assistive people can be.
Title: Advice Seekers Appear Smarter Content: The fear of appearing incompetent or an incompetent person is misplaced, as research shows that the person who is asked for advice thinks good of the person asking. Advice seekers appear smarter to the person whose ego is now stroke, making him provide valuable insights while being impressed by the seeker. Being asked for advice increases the level of perceived competency of the seeker in the eyes of the expert.
Title: Connection Made Thorugh Advice Content: Asking for advice leads to a series of interactions at the office, which gives way to exchanging information, learning and builds a meaningful connection that goes beyond the initial request for advice.
Title: The Self-Confidence of The Advisor Content: Flattery, even if it is in-your-face and false, boosts the psychological mindset of people, especially if they are ‘down’.Studies show that a request for advice makes the advisor feel positive and self-confident, in turn boosting the positive perception of the advice seeker, as a fringe benefit.
