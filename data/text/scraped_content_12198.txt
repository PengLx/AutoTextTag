Title: Kirk Allen Content: .. was a pseudonymous patient of psychoanalyst Robert Lindner, in his 1954 case studies, in which the patient had a dual life, which he could switch by mental time-travel and travel in an instant to the far off future, in which a life of power, respect and conquest was lived by him. This premise was a form of ‘escape hatch’, making science fiction literature a kind of evasion from reality.
Title: The Genre Of Science Fiction Content: ..according to the famous science fiction author Ursula Le Guin has an essential gesture of distancing and pulling back from reality, seeing it from a different plane. It provides a fresh perspective for our righteous wars and our desires to conquer or be conquered. The Fantasy stories of other worlds make our world seem like a foreign society whose culture and rules have many unwanted features that we can try to change.
Title: The Iron Dream Content: .. published in 1972 was an alternate fantasy timeline of Adolf Hitler, in which he lives another kind of life as a science fiction author and illustrator(yes it is far fetched!)
Title: Fantasy World Content: Science Fiction’s constant migration to other worlds is ‘adaptive’ and can be configured to suit the geek crowd, whose interests and tastes are used to provide the kind of fantasy that they would connect with. The bad stuff of the real world is kept out.The fantasy world can be hand-drawn according to one’s wildest dreams.

The make-believe other worlds and adventures of space have received psychological accusations from the authors, like the fact that real-world problems of this planet (like unemployment or worldwide destruction) are too disappointing for the ‘entitled narcissists’ who always migrate to greener pastures to live out their grandiose fantasies.
