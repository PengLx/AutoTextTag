Title: Uncertainty Content: Many people are uncertain about their behaviour and what action they should be taking at any given moment.This uncertainty manifests in fear, stress, and anxiety.Some Zen Ideas on handling uncertainty:Keep the big picture in mind.Take one action at a time.Dance with the uncertainty.Leave no trace.
Title: The Big Picture Content: While dealing with the daily problems and decisions, we need to ask ourselves what do our lives require right now, and what matters the most to us. This reminds us to participate and take action in meaningful work, with a purpose, a mission and a direction. It stops us from acting on impulse or wasting our time during trivial things that don't have any impact.
Title: Turn By Turn Content: You can only take one action at a time, due to time, energy and other constraints. Make sure the action you take is based on the big picture and has the most significant impact. Don't waste your Turn.
Title: Be Friends With Uncertainty Content: Uncertainty cannot be eliminated and must be handled with curiosity, wonder and delight. We must befriend uncertainty and get out of our comfort zones, bringing joy and lightheartedness in it.
Title: Forget Yourself Content: The Zen mind isn't neurotic, narcissistic or filled with ego. You should be doing an action completely lost in it, not thinking about yourself, free from the burden of the self.
