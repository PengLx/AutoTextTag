Title: The critical window of childhood Content: There is an assumption that in the first years of life the vast majority of the brain’s development occurs, and after this period, the trajectory of human development is more or less fixed.The truth is that experience can change both the brain’s physical structure and its functional organization— neuroplasticity. Also,mindful meditation can produce structural brain changes significant enough to be picked up by MRI scanners.
Title: The idle-brain theory Content: Irrespective of what a person is doing, the entire brain is generally active and, depending on the task, some areas are more active than others.People can always learn new ideas and new skills, not by tapping into some unused part of the brain, but by forming new or stronger connections between nerve cells.
Title: The left/right brain hypothesis Content: The theory that most people are either dominantly analytical (and left-brained) or creative (and right-brained) is false.The two hemispheres of the brain are linked and communicate extensively together; they do not work in isolation.Recent studies suggest that engaging all the senses in a variety of ways (for instance, audiovisual and tactile) can help employees retain new content.
