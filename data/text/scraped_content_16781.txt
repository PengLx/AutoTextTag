Title: Remote Employees Content: It’s hard to figure out for managers what kind of people make the best, most productive remote employees.Optimism is the quality to look for, while the trait to avoid is people-pleasing. These two can look similar, and a good manager knows how to separate the two.
Title: Optimists Content: Self-motivation is a great quality for remote workers, as they are at home, only accessible through email or through video conferencing to the manager.High levels of enthusiasm, a positive approach and choice of words provide clues to the manager if someone has an optimistic frame of mind.
Title: People Pleasers Content: If a manager is getting to hear only what is pleasant to hear, at all times, it can be a cause for concern. Remote employees must be willing to say things that aren’t going right, and most of the time, there are many such things. If they can disagree with you, it’s a good sign.Also, if an employee is going out of the way to be liked by colleagues, and wastes a lot of time and mental energy on it, he/she is probably a people pleaser.
