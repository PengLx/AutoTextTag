Title: Work For a Growing Company Content: Growth makes everything else better: it increases your impact, makes your job more important, and presents new problems for you to learn how to solve. Growth makes everything else easier.
Title: Alignment is Vital Content: Alignment or fit doesn't refer to how much you like the person, or how well you get on with your colleagues. It isn't "would I have a beer with this person?"). It's more your alignment with the vision and values of the company - how well do you understand how your company prioritizes, makes decisions, or generally models the world? Being on the same page about these things means that you trust your workers, they trust you and there is a clear sense of autonomy that comes with it.
Title: Mentorship is Key Content: When you're surrounded by great people, and they are providing you with guidance and feedback, you get better really quickly.If your desire is to improve, surrounding yourself with the right people is the fastest way to do so.
Title: Underweight Compensation Content: Provided your goal is to make an impact through your work, income isn't a good way to do it. Impact will more likely come from the work itself.
