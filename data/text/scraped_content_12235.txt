Title: Android Tips to Make Life Easier  Content: Master your Android phone.Android phones come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, but within, they all run the same basic operating system. That Android code includes settings that let you tailor your smartphone to your needs. In this guide, we collected 24 lesser-known customizations for you to toy with.You might not want to play your podcasts at the same volume as your ringtone. To adjust those separately, launch Settings and open the Sound menu. Here, you’ll find volume sliders for media, call, alarms, and ringtones. You can also access individual volume settings by pressing the physical volume button, which will make one slider appear on screen, and then tapping the slider option on the bottom. This will open a menu where you can see all three volume sliders.The latest versions of Android also let you prioritize different types of notifications from a given app. In Gmail, for example, you might choose to receive a noisy alert for important emails and a less obtrusive one for regular updates. Open Settings, tap Apps & notifications , and pick a specific app or tap See all to view a full list. Different apps will offer different categories of alerts, so choose Notifications to view them and configure different sounds for each.Android now optimizes apps so they won’t drain the battery as much. For example, your email app can still run in the background, checking for updates, but it does so less frequently. However, you can exempt certain apps if you want them to always run at full throttle. Open Settings and tap Battery , then the menu button on the top right, then Battery Usage . Here, you’ll be able to see which apps drain your battery according to how much you use them. Tap on any of them and then on Battery Optimization. Next, hit the Not optimized link, then All apps . Finally, select an app and pick the Don’t optimize option.
