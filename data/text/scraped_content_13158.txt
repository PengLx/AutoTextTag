Title: Active immunity Content: By active immunity, we generally understand the resistance that our immune system shows against pathogens. By the so-called 'clonal selection', enough antibodies are built up in order to help our organism fight off colds or different diseases.
Title: Passive immunity Content: Passive immunity refers to the creation of immunity by introducing antibodies from outside the organism, such as the injection of antivenom after having been bitten by a snake.
Title: Immunity categories Content: There are several immunity categories:Nonspecific defenses: these work against all foreign matter and pathogensSpecific defenses: these are specialized in fighting against particular threats Innate immunity: natural immunity that protects one from birth until deathAcquired immunity: it is the third line of defense, which offers protection against specific types of pathogens.
Title: Active immunity features Content:  The need to be exposed to a pathogen or to the antigen of a pathogen, which leads to the production of antibodies The cells involved are of three types: T cells, B cells and anti-presenting cellsImmunity is acquired after several exposures to the antigenActive immunity can last up to an entire lifeThis type of immunity can cause at most some autoimmune disease and allergies, however, there are no issues generally.
Title: Passive immunity features Content: Among the features of passive immunity, the most known are:This type of immunity does not require exposure to antigen or to an infectious agentThe response to an infectious agent is immediateThe immunity is effective on short termThe so-called 'serum sickness' is one of the effects of the exposure to antisera.
