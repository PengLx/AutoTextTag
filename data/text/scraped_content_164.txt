Title: There are no bad emotions Content: Emotions are not “bad” or “good” but simply “comfortable” or “uncomfortable.” And even uncomfortable emotions (like sadness, anger etc) help us point issues we ignored about ourselves.
Title: Stigmatizing "bad" feelings Content: By stigmatizing uncomfortable feelings, we tend to eliminate the visibility of these emotionsin society andpeople who feel sad or depressed believe they are the only ones who feel this way because they don’t see examples of others living with the same emotions around them.
Title:  Content: Understanding the source of the emotion puts you in a position to problem-solve it, which means you are back in control and can resolve the emotion.
Title: Allowing ourselves to sit with difficult emotions Content: Simply feel them by sobbing, screaming into pillows, or punching pillowshelps the emotions run their courses. It’s like the safety valve on a water heater: releasing even a little bit of pressure helps the entire system operate more efficiently.
