Title: Our Sense Of Smell And Our Memories Content: Certain smells that are associated in our minds to events or locations from the past, trigger our memories to revisit them. This association of the past through the sense of smell works better and is more vivid than the sense of touch or sight.Example: Smelling the pages of a new book may remind us of late-night reading as a kid.
