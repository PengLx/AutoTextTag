You need to step back and look at the big picture, finding out if the elements of your life are lined up with what matters to you and what you believe in.Alignment is not about perfection, but direction.
Title: No Fear Content: Aligning your life requires courage. Deciding what you care about and not being afraid to make difficult choices is the way forward.We all have our logical reasons and excuses postponing difficult decisions, but true courage is in making the right move.
Title: Asking for Specialized Help Content: The people we normally speak to regarding our lives: our partners, friends or family members, usually have their own set of agendas and assumptions.Getting professional help to sort out your life is one of the best ways to heal and remember who we are. 
Title: Taking Responsibility for our Life Content: Most of us have been bought up to behave in a certain socially acceptable and normal way, and we simply stick to the script and 'fit' ourselves in a certain mold, living a stereotyped life.We need to take responsibility for creating a life that makes sense for us, as we are the authors of our own lives.
Title: Alignment Content: Creating a joyful and fulfilling life isn't about balance, but about Alignment.An Alignment of our lives can:Clarify our values and priorities.Remove any noise or distraction of other's expectations.Help us find the flow in life.Make us let go of things that cause friction.Bring order to life, rather than just trying to be everywhere, doing everything for everyone.
Title: Balance Content: Most people believe that balancing their lives, making sure everything is in the right proportions, whether it's work, family, social life, finances, etc., is the key to happiness.The problem with 'balance' is that it is based on society's norms and values.
