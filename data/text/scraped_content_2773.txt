Title: Write A Stop-Doing List Content: Remind yourself of items that don’t bring you joy, and contribute very little to your long-term goals.This way, you’re unlikely to spend a lot of time doing time-sucking, non-rewarding work, freeing you up to do the work that does make you happy in the long run.
Title: Schedule Procrastination Breaks Content: During this allotted break, give yourself permission to do time-wasting activities (social media scrolling included) until you got bored and want to move on to your next task.
Title: Divide Your Day Into Themes Content: Andif your job isn’t ideal for focusing on one thing per day, you can dedicate your morning to one focus area, your early afternoon to another, and late afternoon to another.This way, instead of being overly restrictive about finishing a task in that time period, you have the flexibility to do any work that moves you forward in that particular focus area.
Title: Tackling Small Tasks Content: Do the things that make you feel most accomplished.You might feel even more productive when you're confident. And you can gain confidence by crossing off the little tasksthat are easy to do and take little time.
Title: Focusing On One Task At A Time Content: Think about how many times you wasted time worrying about something that’s completely unrelated to what you’re working on.A wandering mind is not always a happy mind. The ability to think about what is not happening is a cognitive achievement that comes at an emotional cost.
