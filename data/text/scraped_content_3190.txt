Title: Categories And Stereotypes Content: To the question 'What do you do'? we usually give one-word answers, that allow people to categorize us and createstereotypes. For example:I’m in sales. They think: You’re a pushy, sweet-talking charmer.I’m a lawyer. They think: You’re the argumentative type.I’m an accountant. They think: You’re a numbers geek.
Title: Talk About How You Help People Content: Start your next response with “I help people…”because it usually takes the stereotype away from your job title.For example: You can say you're a copywriter or you can say you help companies tell compelling stories about their brands.
Title: Tell an Anecdote About Your Job Content: Tell a storyabout something that was fun or inspiring to you at work.It will help you make connections: the brain activity of the storyteller and the listener mirror each other, despite the fact that one person is talking and one is listening.
Title: Make it a Teachable Moment Content: You are educating the other person on the subject of you.So instead of just saying your title, explain something he or she might not know about your work or industry.
Title: Be Vulnerable Content: Make it personal and talk about your journey: talk about your dreams and aspiration, and about whatled you to where you are today, etc.
Title: Be Relevant Content: Pass on the details about you and your work that are relevant to the person you’re talking to.Think about what experiences you have that will resonate with the people you’re talking to or be able to help them out in some way.
Title: Be Self-Promotional Content: You’re doing everyone a favor by being honest about what you’re good at and what lights you up.We need more people who can speak frankly about the value they bring to the clients and organizations with which they work.
