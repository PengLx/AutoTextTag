Title: Addressing Myths About Productivity Content: During a given day, if you accomplish what you intended to do, you had a productive day.Certain ‘productive’ work like answering email or replying to messages is actually a distraction, and can be better managed by blocking specific time slots for execution.You are not on track if you are not doing what is the main objective of the day.Work does not mean ‘paid labor’ but encompasses community service, side projects and even hobbies.
Title: Reflect And Refine Your Calendar Content: Reflect on the time during the day you had done what was the goal, and on what occasions were you distracted. This can be done using time-tracking apps or a simple journal.Refine your calendar by timeboxing your main objectives to map your daily and weekly productivity, along with the real-time improvisations or delays that have occurred.It’s impossible to be completely indistractable, but if we are able to meet our objectives and protect our most precious resource, which is time, then we have ample play in the day to live the life we want.
