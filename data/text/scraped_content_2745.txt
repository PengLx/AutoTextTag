Title: The most influential gift is a journal Content: Journaling initially affords you to get rid of your anger/frustration (with pen and paper).Journaling helps you to get your frustration out before you can direct it at anybody else.
Title: Living in the moment Content: When we write we focus on the details. We write about the little details of an interaction with someone. And most times when journaling we write while the interaction is still fresh in our minds.This strengthens our observation muscle. Then we start looking for little details in our next interaction.
Title: Journaling helps us reflect Content: Journaling increases self-awareness. Recording your thoughts is like stepping in wet concrete. The outline of your foot is now there forever.You can find out who you really are. You can find your weaknesses and new opportunities. You can challenge yourself with those realizations. You can make plans to better yourself.
