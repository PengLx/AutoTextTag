Title: The status shift Content: Busyness proselytizers suggest that Thorstein Veblen’s fin de siècle theory of “conspicuous consumption,” whereby the moneyed class establishes its status through ostentatious spending, has reversed itself:that prestige now derives frompublic displays of personal industriousness, not empty extravagance.
