Title: Water Intake and Water intoxication Content: Drinking when you are thirsty maintains your body's water level within about 1-2% of its ideal state. But as we get older, our sense of thirst can get fuzzier and that is when dehydration can become a threat.Water intoxication occurs when the amount of electrolytes in the body becomes imbalanced by excessive water intake, disrupting brain function. It happens when you drink more than you can pee.
Title: Beer And Coffee Content: New findings show that how much we need to drink may vary with our activity levels, the weather, and our physiology. Other drinks like milk, beer or even coffee provide good levels of hydration. Instead of following the thumb rule of 2 liters of water a day, we can adjust our intake so that we are hydrated adequately.
