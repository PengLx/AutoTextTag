Title: Being assertive Content: In some workplace situations, being persistent can be a sign of confidence and strength.Other times, however, not taking "no" for an answer can make you seem rude and brand you as someone to be avoided.It is good then, to know how to be assertive without being obnoxious.
Title: Offering value Content: Effective persistence should always be based on providing incremental value.From your conversation, you may have gathered insights on something that is important to the other persons, such as family, projects, or key interests. Offer an introduction or invite them to an event of importance.
Title: Valuing time Content: No one is interested in an elaborate saga. Instead, ask a short, clear question on a subject in which the other person has expertise. They'll often be glad to help.Follow up on an agreed time. If they tell you they’ll be busy until the fall, then don’t send them another message on July 31st. Wait until autumn starts and then send a polite note.
Title: Reaching out Content: Consider reaching out to someone with different 'touches', such as a phone call, email, written letter, or an appropriate gift.Pace your follow-ups. Every two weeks is a good starting place, and if they don't respond, try a monthly follow-up.Give them an 'out' if they need one.Keep correspondence light and ongoing, instead of only reaching out when you need help.
