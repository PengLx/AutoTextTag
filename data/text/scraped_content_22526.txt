Title: Moving To A New Place Content: Moving is a great way to open up one’s mind and practice focusing one’s attention without the constant thought patterns. Practising mindfulness frees our mind from thoughts about the old residence and makes our minds less anxious.
Title: Thinking of A New Beginning Content: As you unpack your stuff, use this golden chance to keep only the essential stuff and completely declutter your new home. Don’t hold stuff that keeps you tied to the past. Do not be overwhelmed with the piled up work. Practice deep breathing, reflecting on the present moment and gratitude.
