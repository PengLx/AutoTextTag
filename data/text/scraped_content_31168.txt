Title: Heuristics: Mental Shortcuts Content: In our daily lives, we do not have the time, knowledge or skills to make the perfect decision/choice every time, and it may be too exhausting and time-consuming to make really big decisions in a perfect way all the time. This makes us use mental shortcuts, or heuristics to make â€˜good enough' decisions.Also known as rules of the thumb, heuristics makes us jump forward instead of doing all the hard-thinking, based on tried and tested assumptions that may blind us from the changing world, where nothing stays the same.
Title: Cognitive Bias: The Other End Of Heuristics Content: When our heuristics make us do unreasonable things and ignore obvious dangers, it is termed as a cognitive bias, a systematic error that is based out of our unawareness.These systematic thinking patterns form the mental models that make us perform automated functions, and blind our views towards reality.
Title: The Most Common Cognitive Biases Content: Representativeness Heuristic: assumes that if something reminds us of something we know already, it is part of the same group.Availability Heuristic: The more something comes in front of us, the more likely we think it is.Anchoring Heuristic: Unconsciously giving a disproportionate amount of importance to the first piece of information that is learned.
