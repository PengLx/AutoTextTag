Title: Pay Attention To Your Triggers Content: Be aware of thesituations that spike your anxiety (getting feedback, writing important emails, being put on the spot, or starting the day with a messy desk).When you know what makes you the most uneasy, you can better anticipate challenges and create a plan to deal with triggers.
Title: Prepare A Few Grounding Techniques Content: Anxiety activates the body’s fight or flight response, which sets off a number of uncomfortable reactions from sweating to tunnel vision.Calming yourself with grounding techniques (ways to stay in the present moment) can get you back in control. A few examples: meditation, stretching, calling a friend, or going for a walk.
Title: Invest In Your Well-being Content: While you can’t control most of your environment, make it a point to change what you can.Get enough sleep, avoid too much caffeine, work by a window with natural light, and control noise in your workspace with headphones.
Title: Ask for What You Need Content: Consider making requests that’ll help you in the long term, like soliciting questions ahead of a presentation or asking your boss not to send you late-night emails unless it’s absolutely urgent.Also, know your rights when it comes to managing your mental health (a flex schedule, additional time for assignments, and more frequent breaks).
Title: Set Micro-Goals Content: Be careful to not overwhelm yourself.Setting realistic expectations for yourself is key to not only building positive momentum but also preserving your well-being.
