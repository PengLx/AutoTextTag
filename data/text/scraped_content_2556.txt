Title: Motivation and career success Content:  Research shows being motivated predicts career success better than intelligence, ability, or salary.
Title: Focus On The Meaning  Content: The things that give us deep happiness are inherently things that take longer and have a big element of meaning in them.And ifthe task you have to do doesn’t seem meaningful, try reframing your experience.You might not be able to change what you have to do but you can change how you see it.
Title: Take Ownership Content: When we feel connected to what we’re doing, when we make something our own, we’re much more motivated.Toturn some task you’re handed at the office into something you feel ownership of, make smalltweaks that customize what you have to do, that allow you to do it your way.
Title: The Inside View Content: What looks dreadful on a to-do list usually isn’t that bad when you’re in the middle of it. Focus on the good feelings in the moment.Often, when you look at a task, you take the outside view: you forget the emotional component. And so something you may actually enjoy seems like a chore.
