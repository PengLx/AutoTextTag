Title: Ourblockages Content: The things stopping us from being present or taking the action we want to take are:The stories we have in our heads about other people, what’s happening, and ourselves.Our habit of staying in those stories instead of being present or taking action.
Title: The narrative machine Content: Our minds are wired to come up with narratives (about the world, other people and about ourselves). And these narratives are stopping us from being present and taking action.Examples of stories:If they loved me they wouldn’t be so inconsiderateThis is too hard, I don’t want to do thisI suck, I keep failing, I am inadequateThis shouldn’t be happening to me! This sucks!
Title: Dropping the stories Content: We can’t stop the mind from producing stories but we don't have to cling to them let them occupy our heads.Notice when you’re stuck in a story.Notice that the story is causing you to be stressed or afraid.See if you can drop out of the story and into the present moment.When you go back to your story (because you will), try coming back to the present moment, without judgment. Stay longer.
Title: Taking action Content: The stories in our heads also stop us from taking the action we want to take in our lives. For example: I don’t know how to tackle this big project, it’s too complicated.But you don’t need them to take action. Focus on the present, and just act. Take a “don’t know” mindset. Stay present and stay curious as you act. Stop thinking you know what it will be like ahead of time.
