Title: Identifying your workplace strengths Content: Whenever you're asked what your workplace strengths are, you’ll want to be able to identify them.There are four primary workplace strengths.

Title: Design strength Content: Where the ‘envision strength’ is more subjective, the ‘design strength’ is more objective.These folks like to get to the facts, and are well-suited as planners and very good at answering the question, ‘what do we need to do when?’ We often find these strengths in newly minted MBA’s, analysts, planners, and CFOs.
