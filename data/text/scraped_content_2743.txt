Title: What Is Zen Content: Zen is not a moral teaching, and as it is without dogma, it does not require one to believe in anything. A true spiritual path does not tell people what to believe in; rather it shows them how to think; or, in the case of Zen - what not to think.Zen Buddhism, like a taste or a smell, is a practice that needs to be experienced, not a concept to understand.
Title: Zazen Meditation Content: The practice of Zen meditation (Zazen), is the core of Zen Buddhism and itâ€™s a way of vigilance and self-discovery which is practiced while sitting on a meditation cushion. It is the experience of living from moment to moment, in the here and now and also how Gautama got enlightened and became the Buddha.Zazen is an attitude of spiritual awakening.
Title: Practicing Zazen Content: In a silent place, quietly sit down, stop moving, and let go of your thoughts.Focus just on your Zazen posture and your breathing.Keep your back straight.Let your ego and your unconscious mind melt away, merge with the universe.
