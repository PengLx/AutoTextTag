Title: The Journey to a Better You Content: In life we all go through phases. In essence, each phase aids in our evolution to becoming our best selves. Imagine your life as a highway. There are several lanes to choose from. Each lane passes through different parks, forests, and other attractions. Some lanes lead to a longer commute, maybe with more sight seeing or things to do. While other routes may be a little shorter showing a little bit less scenery, just enough to keep your attention. Whatever lane you choose ultimately lands you at your destination, and everyone's destination story is different. 
Title: How to cut off people who don't serve you.  Content: Cleaning out your closet becomes a necessity when deciding the right people you want to keep in your life. This doesn't always mean that you have to cut people off completely. It just means that you may have to make adjustments to your interactions with such people. ( See what I did there?) ðŸ™‚ Let it sound as it may, but it's the harsh reality of how you may have to deal with others.
