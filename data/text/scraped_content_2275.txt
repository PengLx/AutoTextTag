Title: Look for Logical Overlaps Content: Cut your goal list by identifying relationships between items.Some things will complement one another, and this synergy will allow you to work toward more than one goal at a time. Some may feel likeirreconcilable conflicts.Establish your priorities by articulating your core values and motivations.
Title: Make the Time Content: Replace the phrase “have time” with “make time.”Saying, “I don’t have time to [work towards your goal] ” isn’t doing you any favors. Use " I am making time to [work for your goal]".This way,start thinking of time as being a plentiful resource and declare it to be something within your control.
Title: Avoid Over-Planning Content: Instead ofover-planning, come up with one tangible next step for each item on your dream bucket list, that will get you going in the right direction.Being open to life's serendipity—instead of micromanaging—will make you much happier in the long run.
