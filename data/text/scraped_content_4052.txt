Title: Asking about feelings Content: The act of asking an open-ended question shows that you care. “What does that feel like?” or “What has been on your mind as you’re going through this?”Then, listen non-judgmentally to their response without interrupting or offering your opinion.
Title: Willingness to understand Content: If someone, for instance, has received a new medical diagnosis, you can say, "It sounds like you're worried about the side effects of the treatment. Is that right?"You can also express kindness by saying, “You’re in such a tough situation.” A facial expression is also a powerful way to show support.
Title: Offering support Content: Not every person feels comforted in the same way. Acknowledge that by asking "How can I support you?"It expresses a desire to assist without jumping in to problem-solve.
Title: Negative thoughts Content: Emotional pain can feel unbearable at times, especially if people lack support. It may sometimes lead to harming thoughts.If someone you care about is going through a tough time and had suicidal thoughts in the past, ask them directly if they are thinking of hurting themselves. Research shows that upfront questions may benefit them.
Title: Reassurance Content: Statements like "Everything will be fine," or "It could be worse," rarely help. Instead, try saying things like, "There's help available; we'll find it together," or “I’ve seen you get through extremely challenging times in the past, I believe in you.”
