Title: Time is Limited Yet Abundant Content: Most of us conflict with time.Time is a paradox and is both limited and abundant at the same time. We can do great things with time, provided we know how to use this invisible resource.
Title: Use Time Intentionally Content: Once we realize that every moment is a gift, we will not waste it but use it intentionally, for something important and meaningful. It is important that we set some clear priorities and create space for them.
Title: Contemplating Death Content: This exercise makes us value our limited time and sheds away the unnecessary activities from our day.We start living a vivid life, and slow down, becoming fully present in the moment, savoring time like a limited edition treat before it vanishes.
Title: The Auto-Pilot Mode Content: Getting in an auto-pilot mode with your daily life makes everything move fast, and life becomes too much of a routine.We think we are busy and don't have time but that's not true. We do have the time if the work is our priority, provided we know what is important to do.Most of our time is spent doing what we have decided to spend it on, so we have to choose our priorities wisely.
