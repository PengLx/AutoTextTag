The ego is the whole set of experiences, accumulations, and memories that make up our view of ourselves. The ego holds our prejudices and distortions.Death of the ego means we are open to criticism. We are embracing the process of learning to develop our abilities.

Desiring is a bond, but so is the desire not to desire. To be detached, then, is to be free.
