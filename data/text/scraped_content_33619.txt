Title: ðŸ’¥Should you watch Porn during NoFap Flatline? Content: Watching porn is probably the worst thing you can do during your flatline period.

So they try to test themselves by getting hard.But in reality, your libido is not gone permanently and it will definitely come back after a certain amount of time. This happens because your brain is healing from all those heavy sexual stimulations and need some break.So you should not watch porn at any given condition and if you do so, then it will slow down the healing process.
