Title: Consider it beautiful Content: Insecurity — the vulnerability of spirit — is essentially humility, which is a virtue.Self-consciousness, apartness, an inability to join in, physical shame and self-loathing—they are not all bad.
Title: List your best qualities Content: Ask two or three of your best friends to list ten of your best qualities and put those in there to jumpstart the project.
Title: Avoid people you feel insecure around Content: Sometimes you have to rearrange your schedule, take lunch at a different time, or compile a ton of excuses. You have to protect yourself for as long as you are feeling insecure.Then, when you don’t feel as insecure, you can resume your old schedule or go to happy hour if you want and if your dog has been groomed.
Title: Surround yourself with supportive people Content: Those trusted few are the voices of truth and we need as many voices of truth as we can get.“We’re going to have to let truth scream louder to our souls than the lies that have infected us,” writes Beth Moore in “So Long, Insecurity: You’ve Been a Bad Friend To Us.”
Title: Invisible insecurities Content: You figure everyone can see that you’re insecure. And that actually makes you feel more insecure.No one can see your insecurity. They are too worried about their own insecurity to notice your insecurity. No one can see your insides but you.
