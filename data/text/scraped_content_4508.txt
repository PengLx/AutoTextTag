Title: Our Inner Child Content: According to Sigmund Freud, mental disorders and destructive behavior patterns are more or less related to our inner child, which most of us fail to see directly.Our inner child needs to be acknowledged, accepted, nurtured and loved, instead of being denied, neglected, abandoned and rejected.
Title: Negating Our Inner Child Content: Whenever our inner child surfaces, we are told by society to grow up, throwing aside or killing childish things like innocence, wonder, awe, joy, sensitivity, and playfulness.Most grown-ups don't realize that they are not grown-ups at all, but emotionally wounded children inhabiting adult bodies.And a wounded inner child is the root cause of bad relationships, bad career, and of the persistent negative emotions of fear, anxiety, insecurity, and inferiority.
Title: Nourish Your Inner Child Content: Adults should relate to their inner child just like a parent, providing love, support, discipline, boundaries, structure, nurturance, and acceptance.This constant communication and care of the inner child commences towards a mutually beneficial, cooperative, symbiotic relationship.
