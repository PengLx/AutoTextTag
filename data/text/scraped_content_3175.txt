Title: Get and stay physically calm Content: Start by counting to 100 by threes so you will have to think a little. It may momentarily distract you from the panic and you'll have a better chance to think clearly.
Title: Look for perspective Content: Most work crises are overblown. It is important for those caught in the moment to search for perspective by asking themselves if it is a major problem or a problem that is quite fixable.
Title: Try to be the voice of reason Content: If you can cultivate the ability to stay calm and look for useful solutions, you will find yourself respected for it. The ability to stay calm yourself makes others calmer.
