Title: Listening To Advice Content: Most people hear out the advice given to them out of politeness or obligation, with no intention of every following it, no matter how practical or beneficial it may be.Our ego doesn't let us follow advice.The keywords that we say before we dole out the advice seem to matter more than we think.
Title: Pre-suasion Content: Reminding people about their core values before any advice is provided, makes them more receptive towards it.When the person thinks about their core values, an area of their brain called the Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (VMPC) gets activated, making them take some tangible action towards your advice. This pre-suasion before we influence any person (for their own good) is important and essential if we want them to follow genuine advice.
