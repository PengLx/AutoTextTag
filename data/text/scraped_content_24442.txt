Title: The Definition Of Success Content: If a person achieves what he set out to do, and is able to reach the goal they set for themselves, they are considered to be successful.There are three positive traits that help us align towards our set goals, and make success easier and faster for us: Perseverance, emotional intelligence and humility.
Title: Perseverance In Doing The Right Thing Content: If we keep out a million distractions surrounding us and think about our goal day and night, we will succeed in our goal, no matter what. The key here is continued focus, and also making the right thing as our goal.If the aim is only money, it may not help us much, but if we keep our aim towards learning or striving to become better at something, we achieve success in monetary terms as a bonus.
Title: Emotional Intelligence and Success Content: Emotional Intelligence, the ability to understand yourself and the people that you live and work with, is an excellent trait to balance and correct yourself.Everything and everyone is connected to one another forming a huge ecosystem. Our endeavours, whether to get a job, to lose weight or to find a life partner is always related to others.
Title: Humility And Our Willingness To Learn Content: One of the best traits in life is the continuous hunger to learn and be open to feedback. Being humble makes us leave our ego aside, breaking down the walls around us.Humility makes us learn from one another, and stand upon the shoulders of giants. Instead of comparing ourselves with others, we have to create our own definitions of success.
