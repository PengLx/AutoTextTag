Title: A Feeling Of Unworthiness Content: Feelings of being unworthy and a burden on others can be common among people. It is usually a mixture of low self-esteem and introvertedness, coupled with a tendency to not express oneâ€™s feelings, and keeping them bottled up.
Title: Stop Identifying With Your Feelings Content: The error that we make is identifying ourselves with our emotions. We are by ourselves perfect, but we were never told this. Our feelings are not us. Our fear is a separate entity, which we can handle, and tame. We feel angry but cannot become anger ourselves.Our feeling of unworthiness is due to our mistakenly identifying the rising and falling emotions as facts.
