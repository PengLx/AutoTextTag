Title: Train yourself to think Content: The words you habitually use when you're thinking (and then expressing those thoughts) mold how you see the world. For example, people who habituallythink (and speak and write) the word "hate" tend to find an ever-increasing number of things to hate.When you train yourself to speak and write using clearly defined words arranged into concise sentences, you're training your brain to think more clearly.
Title: Mentally edit out fuzzy buzzwords Content: While most business buzzwords are simply annoying (like saying "utilize" rather than "use"), some are so fuzzy and vague that they automatically lead to confused thinking.Mentally editing out the fuzzy, vague buzzwords when you are talking, speaking, listening, or reading gradually clears your mind of the confusion they create, thereby making you smarter.
Title: Simplify your business writing Content: If you find yourself writing or reading long, complex sentences at work, edit and reedit them so that they express the gist infewer words.Do this repeatedly and over time you'll automatically accustom your brain to shorter, clearer wordings.
Title: Play the "one syllable" game Content: The concept is simple: Try to communicate business ideas using words of only one syllable.This exercise trains your brain to use smaller, easier-to-understand words rather than complex ones.Since complex words tend to "complexify" your thoughts (and your expression of them), habitually using common words leads toward clearer thinking.
