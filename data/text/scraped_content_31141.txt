Title: Moderation as a virtue Content: Moderation, a middle point between two extremes, has been considered a key virtue for thousands of years.Today, instead of understanding and admiring moderation, we've come to view it as a weakness. When we look at money, more is better. We consider the person with the most as the happiest and the best. Television is possible because of immoderate people. The pop and influencer culture rests almost entirely on people who have given themselves over to the pursuit of total pleasure and fame.
Title: We even get “Epicurean” wrong Content: A patron once offered Epicurus whatever he wanted. Epicurus could have requested riches but asked for a small pot of cheese. Epicurus knew that simple pleasures, enjoyed in moderation, were most enjoyable.A pleasant life is as inseparable from moderation as it is from other virtues such as prudence, honour, and justice.
Title: Moderation means being smart Content: Moderation is knowing what enough is.It is stopping when it is still good. It's about leaving a little on the table. It means being merciful to the other side when you win. The ability to know when to compromise is a feature, not a fault.
