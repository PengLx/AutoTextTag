Title: Unrequited Love Content: It is a feeling of being obsessive or fixated about a person as if one has found an oasis in a desert of nothingness.Insisting that the relationship will work out exactly as you want can be a frustrating experience when confronted with reality.It may seem like the person that is the object of our affection holds the key to our happiness, which is never true. It is good to know that what you are dealing with is your own mind, not the other person, and are placing your chances of happiness at something beyond your control.
Title: The Other Person Content: The other person can sense the unease, the possessive desperation, neediness, and even creepiness in you that arises from 'clinging' towards them.Even if we play it cool, and follow the dating norms and etiquettes, the 'needy' energy can leak out of us, repelling the other person. If you are feeling like that, it is best to listen to yourself with compassion.
Title: Self-Examination Content: Being left alone or not being able to have a fulfilling relationship with one person is a perfect opportunity for self-discovery and self-examination.Instead of waiting for the other person to suddenly start loving you (an external event you cannot control) you are much better off understanding the situation objectively, absorbing the learning it brings.Love can come from diverse sources if you are open to life, alternatives and possibilities.
