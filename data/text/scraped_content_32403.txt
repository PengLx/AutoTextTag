Title: Overusing "I'm Sorry" Content: According to psychologists, we habitually apologize in our communication, but we can learn to be considerate without saying the word "sorry".We don’t have to needlessly apologize for everything we do. Overusing the word "sorry" makes us feel timid, unconsciously diminishing our confidence.
Title: Alternatives To Saying Sorry Content: We can eliminate 'Sorry' from our vocabulary when we bump into someone, and replace it with ‘Go ahead’, ‘Pardon me’ or ‘After you’, for example.During meetings, we can use phrases like ‘I have an Idea’ or ‘I would like to add…’.
Title: Say Thank You Not Sorry Content: Gratitude is the best way to end the sorry pandemic, and we can always thank the other person(s) for whatever small inconvenience there was (like waiting).We can also cultivate a habit of pointing out to the other person if a sorry isn’t required.
