Title: Evolution of time management in 5 stages Content: The Clock-Slave: you are either begging for the clock to speed up or slow down.The Time Tracker: some find it an excellent way of ensuring they stay on track. But when combined with excessive time pressure, it becomes unhealthy.The Smart Breaker: you use like the Pomodoro technique or the Ultradian rhythms.The Free Spirit: you opt for a more spontaneous and free life, and avoid keeping a rigid schedule at all costs. The Enlightened One: you understand that scarcity of time is an illusion. That enemy does not exist.
Title: The scarcity spiral Content: When you are time-pressured, you see time as a precious and scarce resource. This triggers a stress response, which can improve motivation in the short term, but often at the expense of morale in the long term. And an unhappy worker is a less productive worker. With lower productivity, there is even more time pressure to get things done.And on goes the cycle.
Title: The inner tyrant Content: When a time constraint is placed on you, it will play on repeat in your head: “Get to work!”. If a task takes longer than expected, thoughts like “What is taking so long?" might appear. And at the end of a chaotic day, you might find yourself thinking “You have done nothing today!”.But you can overthrow this tyrant.
Title: The abundance spiral Content: Without the time pressure, you view time from an hourglass half-full perspective.This perceived abundance of time improves wellbeing, which in turn increases productivity. When productivity is high, there is less time pressure, and time feels even more abundant.
