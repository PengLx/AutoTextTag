Title: The Fear of Public Speaking Content: Public speaking is often topping the charts as the No. 1 fear in the world.People feel anxious, sweaty, or have a pounding heart while being on stage in front of an audience.
Title: Practice Content: A great way to remove a large portion of fear is to practice hard, studying the topic well. You can research all questions that the audience may ask, and practice the speech in front of a mirror or in front of friends.Practicing soothes our nerves, making us ready for the final audience.
Title: Bigger Than Your Fears Content: Finding something bigger than your fear, greater than your anxiety, is a key strategy to get rid of the natural negative emotions.When you talk about something you are passionate about, the words come naturally, in a flow.Even if the words are forgotten, you can easily bounce back, as your inner fire won't let the words fail you.
Title: What Works For You Content: Finding out what works for you to give your best presentation is important. Make a list of what you have to do in front of the audience and go over the list to help you remember. If you are still feeling afraid, you need to face your fear and make yourself comfortable with the fact that it's not the end of the world.
Title: Relax Content: Certain relaxation techniques like deep breathing, or speaking slowly, calm us and get us out of our irrational fears.Speaking slowly is also better than speaking at a fast rate, which can make you lose your breath, showing the audience that you may, in fact, be scared.
Title: Be Natural Be Yourself Content: Trying to be someone else, or copying someone's style can show in your presentation.Being yourself makes you speak from your heart, with your beliefs and experiences coming out. Speaking the truth, and being honest is freeing, and can give your presentations more power.
