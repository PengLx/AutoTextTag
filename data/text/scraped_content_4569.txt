Title: The victim mindset Content: It happens when we focus on how you believe other people are doing you wrong or what you think they are doing to cause you pain. It means focusing on other people's flaws and how you feel mistreated.This fuels feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, and despair.
Title: Looking in the right direction Content: How someone else treats you is outside your control.But noticing who or what you are exposing yourself to is within your control. And so you should focus on that.
Title: Self-assessment Content: Be honest with yourself. If you are part of the problem, then you are also part of the solution.Stop blaming others. If you feel helpless over a situation, it’s usually because you can’t see your part in it. Be aware of how you are standing in your own way.
