Title: Small things add up Content: Small, Smart Choices + Consistency + Time = RADICAL DIFFERENCE
Title: Be consistent Content: Consistency and a series of purposeful actions will transform the way you work and hone in your chosen craft.Instead of focusing on the outcome, concentrate on your small actions. Narrow your focus to a few minutes or hours of work on your goal, rather than looking at the goal as one big step or achievement.
