Title: Attention Management Content: It's is the practice of controlling distractions, being present in the moment, finding flow, and maximizing focus, so you can create a life of choice, around things that are important to you.It is the ability to recognize when your attention is being stolen (or has the potential to be stolen) and to instead keep it focused on the activities you choose.
Title: Choosing What You Attend To Content: Attention management offers a deliberate approach that puts you back in control, by managing both external and internal factors.Practicing attention management means fighting back against the distractions and creating opportunities throughout your day to support your priorities.
Title: Controlling External Factors Content: Control your technology:it’s there to serve you, not the other way around. As often as possible and especially when you’re working, keep your phone silent and out of sight.Control your environment. Set boundaries with others, especially in an open-office setting. For example, use headphones or put up a “do not disturb” sign when you need to focus.
Title: Controlling Internal Factors Content: Control your behavior:for example, open only one window on your computer screen, and give your full attention to one task until it’s complete, or until a designated stopping point.Control your thoughts: practice noticing when your mind is veering off in its own direction, and gently guide your focus back to where you want it.
