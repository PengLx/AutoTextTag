Title: HIIT: high-intensity interval training Content: HIIT workouts generally combine short bursts of intense heart-pounding exercise (during which a person’s heart rate reaches at least 80 percent of its maximum capacity, usually for 1 to 5 minutes) with periods of rest or lower-intensity exercise.
Title: The most well-established benefit of HIIT... Content: ...has to do with heart health: Intervals can boost cardio-respiratory health with a smaller time investment compared to continuous forms of exercise.It's not about superior fat-burning capacity or bigger muscles, but about improved VO2 max, a measure of endurance that calculates the maximum volume of oxygen the body can use.VO2 max is one of the best predictors of overall health.
Title: HIIT and weight loss Content: People can burn comparable amounts of calories in HIIT routines lasting, compared to longer continuous exercise routines. But this doesn't mean that calorie burn translates into weight loss.This is the problem with HIIT, just like with any other form of exercise: it’s much easier to lose weight by cutting calories in your diet than trying to burn excess calories.
