Kennedy and Richard Nixon helped Kennedy become more popular, only because of his good looks, while Nixon, just recovered from a recent hospitalization, lost points.The impact of the television could be easily seen then, as the people who listened to the debate on the radio thought Nixon had won, while the ones watching TV thought Kennedy had.
