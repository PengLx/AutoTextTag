Title: Noisy Existence Content: Our lives are infiltrated by noise and distractions.We let ourselves get distracted by phone rings, notifications, email, etc., which take up most of our day.Even when there is no distraction, the phone silently sitting next to you is a psychological distraction in itself, as you know that it can disturb you any second.
Title: Getting Bored is Crucial Content: While our entire day is stuffed with noises of all kinds, getting quiet time, doing nothing gets more and more crucial.We need to be able to look at nothing, with no input going inside us, listening to nothing and get in a state of 'boredom', with no smartphone or computer to poke your mind.We don't get any bright ideas in front of the computer, but the mind can activate while driving, in the shower, and at times when we are not engaged in any mental activity.
Title: Let Your Mind Wander Content: Studies show that letting your mind wander activates it.It makes you more productive and goal-oriented, as you have provided your mind with some space, to play around and grow.If you are sitting, you will automatically pick up your phone (or iPad), so a better way is to go running or hiking, with the phone turned off, and let your mind refresh itself doing anything, daydreaming, singing or planning.
