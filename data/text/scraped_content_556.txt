Title: Not Asking for Help Content: There are a handful of reasons we don’t ask for help, but it’s usually because we’re too proud or scared, and that’s a huge waste of time, because it keeps you from moving forward. If you feel stuck in your career or need to learn new skills and have no idea how to get started, talking to other people in your field will go a long way.
Title: Trying to Make Bad Relationships Work Content: Reasons people usually use:Thinking you have more in common with the person you're dating than you actually do;Being in a relationship just to avoid loneliness;Staying in a relationship only out of fear of losing the person.Bad relationships cloud your judgment, prolong your unhappiness, and distract you from things that matter to you most.
Title: Dwelling on Your Mistakes Content: Learning from your mistakes is one thing. Dwelling on them wastes your time, diminishes your confidence, and keeps you from getting on with your life. Dwelling makes you feel like a failure. When you feel like a failure, it’s easy to tell yourself there’s no point in trying, because you already suck.
Title: Worrying Too Much About Other People Content: It’s easy to waste time worrying about other people, too. Your friends and loved ones mean a lot to you, and you want to spend time nurturing them.But we also spend a lot of time fretting over problems that don’t matter in the long run. Those habits always lead to a dead end, because they don't involve action.
