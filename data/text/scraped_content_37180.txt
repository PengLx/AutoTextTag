Title: Organic Cig, real deal? Content: "Organic,” “natural” or “additive-free” product labels may imply a healthier or safer choice, but that couldn’t be further from the truth when it comes to tobacco products.Even though there is no evidence that “natural,” “organic” or “additive-free” cigarettes are any safer or are less harmful than other cigarettes, why do so many people think otherwise?"Our research shows that a majority of Natural American Spirit smokers incorrectly believe that their cigarettes are safer than other cigarettes,” saidRobin Koval, CEO and president of Truth Initiative .
Title: Words have power Content: These labels are so problematic that the Food and Drug Administration has required Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, the maker of Natural American Spirit cigarettes, to remove the terms “natural” and “additive-free” from its product labels, advertising and promotional materials because they constitute reduced harm claims, which are banned without agency approval. The company is still permitted to use “Natural” as part of its brand name, and the FDA failed to address the use of “organic.”Truth Initiative hasurged the FDA to take enforcement action against Santa Fe and Reynolds American, Inc. for marketing Natural American Spirit cigarettes with reduced harm claimswithout approval. The FDA should determine that Natural American Spirit cigarettes are illegally on the market, and therefore prohibit the use of any term that suggests reduced risk or reduced exposure to harmful substances — including “organic” — in the promotion of products and in the brand name itself.
