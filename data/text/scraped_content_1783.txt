Title: The "loser" story of Jordan Williamson Content: Jordan Williamson, the highly recruited high school star and once lofty in the college football world as Stanford University's star kicker, missed twice during a football game and cost the team the game.In the locker room, Jordan wept uncontrollably."For months I was depressed and did not want to go out in public."
Title: How a "loser" became a "winner" Content: "I decided to stop hiding and acknowledge what had happened... I showed my scars and let it be known to everyone that I was accepting reality. By showing my vulnerability it seemed that society, for the most part, put the negativity to rest. While the pain was still there, it was much more dim. I showed myself and others that I accepted myself as a human being who is not perfect and makes mistakes and sometimes fails miserably. This was the beginning of my healing." -Jordan Williamson
