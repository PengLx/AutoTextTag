Title: Shared Culture in Personal Relations Content: One of the reasons for bonding between groups of people is the shared culture that they have created. Culture is an invisible presence, a set of beliefs, history and rituals that encapsulates the values of the group, their conduct and their vision. This applies to movements, companies, and families.
Title: Large Groups Vs Small Content: A culture created in a two-way relationship or a small group is positive and open because it allows for differences to exist, which are not allowed by large groups in which cultures are attached to your identity.Creating the right kind of culture organically is the magic of a strong relationship, something that is difficult in large groups with a shared ideology.
Title: Connections and Happiness Content: The idea of a complete and fulfilling life is always related to personal relationships. Happiness, in a way, is the other person. Happiness is our connections, and the relationships we foster, which create and shape us.It's a lost art to cultivate personal relationships without agenda or motive, just connecting and trying to understand and relate to different people.
