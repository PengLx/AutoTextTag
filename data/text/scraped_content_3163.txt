Title: Using reminders Content: We use memory devices to offload our need to remember everything all the time. But these tools have slowly shifted from a source of calm to just another source of interruption.For example, you're working and you suddenly hear a notification pop, reminding you of a meeting in 30 minutes. Your brain will go in the meeting mode and you won't be able to go back to the task you were doing.
Title: Reminders and mental space Content: Reminders give us mental space for more important work. They make sense because we can't remember everything.They keep our most important priorities top of mind. And studies show howreminders can help us save more money, keep up with medical treatments, and be more charitable.
Title: Reminders: the bad side Content: We’re bombarded by reminders and notifications every day and this can mess up our focus.Reminders cause context switching and distraction.They take our focus away from what we're doing.Good reminders lose their influence quickly. The sheer number of them means we’re more likely to miss the ones we do want to pay attention to.
