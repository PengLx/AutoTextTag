Title: The Illusion Of Control Content: We need to let go of the obsessive tracking of news and unnecessary hoarding of stuff, as these only offer an illusion of control, taking away our peace.We cannot manage the complex flow of global events even if we think we can.
Title: Aware Of The Now Content: Being in the now, and not letting your mind wander, will ensure we are living life to the fullest, in the present moment. If we keep our minds engrossed in imaginary future scenarios, we would not be able to pay full attention to the needs of the present moment.Be here now, and feel the sensation of being alive and breathing, ready for what life has for you.
Title: Accept Reality Content: Instead of being at war with reality, accept the facts, as your resistance is only providing you with more worry, anxiety, and fear, instead of clarity.
