Title: Reward yourself Content: Make sure to treat yourself to something you really enjoy, after you finish working on your tasks.Giving yourself something to look forward to will motivate you to start working. And most times you'll find that once you start, it will get easier to keep going.
Title: Break down tasks Content: Big tasks tend to overwhelm and demotivate us.As a result, we often donâ€™t bother getting starting on something we want to do.So instead of having a number of large tasks to do or one big task, just set one small task for now. This will make your work seem more manageable.
Title: A mental warm up Content: It can be difficult to go from waking up in the morning to getting yourself working right away. So give yourself a mental warm up exercise beforehand.For example, tryreading an interesting book that gets your brain going, write down your ideas or do some crossword/Sudoku puzzles.
