Title: Managing Time Content: The problem about time management is that it’s not about time at all.Time cannot and will not be managed, and you will never get more of it. The problem is rooted in the choices you are making with others and your own choices. You choose how to use it every moment of every day, whether you believe you do or not.
Title: Smart Choices Content: How we choose to respond to others and to our work also determine our ultimate outcomes.Next time: choose to walk away from that complaining coworker, choose your lunch break instead of your work, choose to focus on you work instead of the ‘ping’ of someone’s red-flagged email, and choose to stand up for yourself and say “NO” when you are asked to do more than you are able.
Title: Get Real Content: Get really honest with yourself, your work situation, and your surroundings.Look around at your office and figure out if the set up or schedule works at all for what you are trying to achieve. For example, if you are a person that needs quiet to concentrate but are surrounded by chaos, what can you do to alter your environment, schedule or set-up to give you some quiet?
Title: Set Expectations Content: It's about how you are teaching others to treat you.If you answer those work emails at 11pm, your coworkers and boss will quickly learn that you will make yourself available in the middle of the night. Examine whose expectations you are trying to meet in each situation. Not sure of what’s expected of you in a situation or project? Ask for clear expectations.
