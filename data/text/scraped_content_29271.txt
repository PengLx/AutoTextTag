Title: Our Worldview Is Disrupted Content: Due to the highly unpredictable and uncertain nature of certain events, our opinion about the world has turned largely subjective and detached from reality, because reality itself has become elusive and hard to grasp.Our mental projections and division of thoughts are creating unique representations about our world which have become our own truth.
Title: How Our Opinions Are Shaped Content: Our belief systems are constructed by our teachers, parents, TV, the internet (mainly social media) and books.Collective thought is considered more powerful than an individual thought.The society is not a singular, objective reality, but a series of different ‘movies’ created inside everyone's head.
Title: Being Open-Minded Content: Cultural Intelligence requires us to be open-minded to alternatives, and not be too attached to our belief systems, assumptions and what all we have learned over the years.One has to understand that everything is fluid, and it is not necessary that we are always right and the other person is always wrong. We have to be concerned with meaning, not with opinions about who is right.
