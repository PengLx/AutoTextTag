Title: Anticipation Content: Anticipation can be described as a yearning or a desire to get something that would give you a burst of good feelings.Anticipation precedes experience. Experience strengthens your anticipation and may set a new standard of enjoyment and expectation for future events.
Title: The magic spell of desire Content: Every thought has a desire behind it. It fuels the mind to divert attention from the current moment and instead focus on the spell of desire. If I receive a message from someone from work, I anticipate how I will feel reading the message. All focus is on predicting the next moment and checking if it matches the anticipated outcome. Life gives many opportunities to build more anticipation with lots of new events happening. Daily notifications on the phone are continuously distracting us from reality. We have become a Pavlovian dog without even noticing it.
Title: Desire results in two outcomes Content: On the one end, desire cultivates anticipation. On the other, it fosters fear. Positive outcomes build anticipation, and negative outcomes build fear from desire. In both cases, reality slips by unnoticed in the background. If we overcome desire, we eliminate anticipation and fear.
