Title: Hanlon’s Razor: The Mental Model Content: Understanding Hanlon's razor results in a mindset shift, which enables us to view the entire scenario in a third person’s perspective, rather than being in the centre of the drama.Something we assume is due to bad intentions of others may be just due to ignorance, incompetence, negligence, misunderstanding, laziness or any other probable cause. The negativity trap that our wrong assumptions create can shut all doors of communication. Negative experiences also have more mileage than positive ones.
