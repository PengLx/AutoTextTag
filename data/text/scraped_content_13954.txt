Title: Code And Sort Content: Create a topic of your research assignment along with the subtopics labeled as A, B, C, D etc. Each topic can now be a different pile, separated with the help of sticky notes.Now sort all your papers according to the piles, and when they are complete, start to label each piece of research with a letter and a number. So Your papers would be labeled like A1, A2, B1, B3 and so on.
Title: Piles of Notes Content: Place your piles into separate folders labeled like the subtopics, stapling the sticky notes on the outside of itâ€™s matching folder.Now you can start writing your paper as you have chronological, topic-wise segregation of all your notes.
