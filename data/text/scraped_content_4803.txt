Title: Suppressing Emotions Content: We usually adopt cold and technical solutions to the problems being faced by the world, with little regard to 'unstable' feelings like passion and emotion.As a species, we have always suppressed our emotions (the heart) seeing them as a roadblock and worked with dispassionate calculations (our mind).By discarding our feelings, we may have neglected an integral part of our moral, social and personal well-being, which may be extremely vital to the complex issues faced today.
Title: Emotionally Healthy Content: Emotions can help us handle complex issues, and are an essential part of rational thinking;they are helping us envision future scenarios and this is called pragmatic prospection.An 'emotionally healthy' mindset can be developed by the self-transcendent emotions like empathy, gratitude and wonder, which are focused on others.
Title: Emotional Rescue Content: The world's problems like global warming, air and plastic pollution, and terrorism cannot be solved without empathy. A lack of empathy makes us focus on short-term goals, and our greed, ignoring the larger, more difficult problems that need to be tackled.Even if someone does have empathy, it is limited to one's inner circle, and not towards humanity in general.Our empathy needs to be towards the entire planet and its inhabitants. The current age should harness humanity's emotional side if our future generations want to remember us as 'good' ancestors.
