Title: Network diversity Content: Our networks are usually formed around shared experiences and they influence the way we see the work, how we think and the opportunities we give and receive.So a lack of diversity inside our networkscan propagate inequitable systems and create echo chambers of perspectives.
Title: Professional networks Content: They usually comprise the colleagues we work with (team members or project collaborators). It may not seem like it, but we do have a lot of influence over the broader makeup of these networks.We choose the people we spend time with (at lunch or coffee), the people we mentor or the people we seek advice from.Being intentional about the diversity of that network will result in better decision making for us and our companies.
Title: Social networks  Content: They have an influence over the way we think and ultimately, over our work outputs.To diversify our social networks, we can start by following and connecting with people that hold different identities and viewpoints. 
Title: Centered Spaces Content: Although having diverse networks is very important for expanding circles of influence and achieving equitable results, there is also a need for centered spaces, particularly for populations that are underrepresented or marginalized in the workplace.
