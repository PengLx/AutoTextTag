Title: Disruption of Progress Content: Whenever an outside force interrupts our progress - we skip gym for a day or two for example - it sends a message to our brains that we aren't good enough and we can't do it and that we should just give up.Disruption is the biggest obstacle to overcome but we can always change this habit if we look at it with fresh eyes. Instead of seeing it as a negative event, look at is as a fresh start, like it's something we've never seen before. It would help open our minds to the curiosity and possibilities.
Title: The Magic of a Fresh Start Content: A fresh start allows us to let go of what's happened in the past and just be present for ourselves at the moment. It allows us to learn from our failures and gives us the opportunity to do better, to be better, and to grow past the difficulties.We are allowed to reinvent ourselves and what ever we may be facing. We can reinvent what we want our lives to be. We can always recommit, and remind ourselves why we are committed to this. This fresh start is available to us in every single moment.
