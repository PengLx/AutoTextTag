Title: Safe choices Content: Following the status quo does not always make us feel that we are living with purpose.If you live your life by simply comparing yourself to other people, you will always be subject to other people's standards and needs.
Title: Making space for possibilities Content: Making space to take on risk is all about the journey. You have to unlearn what no longer serves you. For example, unlearning other peoples quick fixes and schemes.
