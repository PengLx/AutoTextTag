Title: Pursue what appears to be a paradox Content: It will force you to reexamine the full body of evidence with new eyes.Seeking relevant knowledge in unfamiliar disciplines increases the odds of serendipitous insights and allows novel empirical patterns to emerge.
Title: Spot contradictions and novel patterns Content: Go on cross-disciplinary research expeditions.By reading and translating the literature in fields outside your own, the full body of evidence surrounding a problem become apparent.
Title: Focus on data and methods Content: Ignore the author’s conclusions.When you are doing cross-disciplinary research what really matters is the structure of the full body of evidence rather than any authors’ particular interpretation of their data in one paper, which is often biased.
Title: Don’t rely on fancy statistics Content: They can obscure the structure of evidence.Remain skeptical of all statistical and mathematical modeling procedures that pre-process evidence while leaving little trace of its original structure.Start out close to the data by scrutinizing frequency distributions, means, standard deviations, how variables are actually measured, degree of measurement error, zero-order correlations, and sample composition.
Title: There is no single formula  Content: Be open to have your basic presumptions shattered.Strategies for solving scientific mysteries:pin down why perspectives on them differ and what each has to offertry to locate the essential core of available evidencenot put much stock in any single study or piece of evidencewatch for recurring patterns in the most reliable datathink through likely counterargumentsand look hard for holes in my evidence and logic.
