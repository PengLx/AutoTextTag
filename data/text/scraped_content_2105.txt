Title: Expose yourself to good ideas Content: Output comes from input. If you want to have a lot of good ideas, you need to expose yourself to good ideas.This means reading books, having conversations with interesting people, seeking out new experiences, travel and more.
Title: Have a capture mechanism Content: Creative ideas often come to you when you’re not deliberately trying to solve a problem, when your mind is relaxed.That's why your creative process must include a system to capture ideas when you have them, so you can work on them later.The simplest mechanism is simply to have a list where you keep ideas.
Title: Incubate your ideas Content: Regularly review your ideas lists.Incubation helps because just as a spontaneous connection can generate an idea, an incubated idea can spontaneously mature into a plan of action if you take care of it.
Title: Have a pipeline for execution Content: Pipelining is a methodology for working on more than one thing at a time, by having various stages of the process get worked on.The different stages in the process, with time in between, allows space to think and edit.
Title: The generative flow mindset Content: Is where you let ideas come to you easily and you don’t look at them too critically. This mindset is expansive, relaxed, open and positive.The advantage of this flow is that you create a lot of ideas.The downside is that a lot of them are bad.
Title: The critical flow mindset Content: Is where you edit and tear down the ideas you’ve made. You spot flaws and you edit ruthlessly.This mindset is closed, focused, critical and precise. The advantage of this flow is that you can make your work a lot better.The downside is that it can often block you from thinking of new ideas because they get rejected too quickly.
