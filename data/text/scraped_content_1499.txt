Imagine your belly button touching your spine.Once you’re comfortable with a full, deep breath, repeat it, this time making the exhale twice as long as the length of the inhale.

Hold the air in your lungs for a count of four.The movement should feel fluid and open.Exhale smoothly, starting at the chest and moving to the belly, for four slow counts. Complete the box with a pause of four before beginning another repetition.Continue this technique for five minutes.
