Title: Pioneers Content: They value possibilities and they spark energy and imagination.They tend to be creative thinkers who believe taking big risks can produce great outcomes. They are outgoing, spontaneous and adaptable.
Title: Guardians Content: They favor stability, order and rigor.Likely to stick with the status quo, they are deliberate decision-makers who are practical, focused on detail and reserved.
Title: Drivers Content: They value change and they generate momentum.Direct in the approach to people and problems, they are technical, quantitative and logical.
Title: Integrators Content: They value connection and tend to draw teams together.They are empathetic, diplomatic and focused on relationships. They acknowledge nuances and tend to see things in shades of grey rather than black and white.
Title: Fitting into a working style Content: While the benefits of diversity are real, they're far from automatic. They must be activated.Nobody fits neatly into each slot of the four basic working styles (Pioneers, guardians, drivers, integrators), but having an understanding ofhow different types of people think and are likely to work, managers can develop more effective teams and build on this diversity.
