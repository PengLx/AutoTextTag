Title: Money doesn't always motivate Content: We may think of money as a great motivator, but it is a very poor one.Money is a good motivator only for boring jobs. For creativity or problem-solving activities, money reduces our natural motivation.
Title: Feeling the importance of our actions Content: If we really want to be motivated, having a goal is not enough. We need to feel something. When we feel that what we do has meaning, we will feel motivated.Workers who fail to live up to their potential have lost sight of the importance and meaningfulness of their own jobs. If you could remind employees of the importance of their jobs, they might become highly motivated and productive.
Title: Giving mundane jobs meaning Content: We can find meaning when we tell ourselves stories. Reflecting on ourselves and how we see ourselves creates an almost instant change in behavior. Self-awareness involves comparing the self to the ideas of what we should or could be.When people are told that their actions are being filmed, they consistently change their behavior. They work harder and are more consistent in their actions and values.
Title: The best motivator Content: Progress is what makes stories feel real. And just as the stories don't need to be real, neither does the progress. The illusion of progress is enough to inspire you to action.
