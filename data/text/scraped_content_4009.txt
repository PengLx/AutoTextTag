Title: Uncertainty Content: Many times in life, in the middle of our journey, we tell ourselves:“I don’t know what I want to be.I don’t know what I want for a living. Idon’t know if I want this relationship.”These “I don’t know what I want”statements are not because we don't know what we want, but because we want a lot of things and cannot choose.
Title: Opportunity Cost Content: We think of our opportunity cost if we decide to do something, fearing it is hampering our options and time, so we stay in limbo unable to decide on what to do.Life is meant to be an experience, not something you plan and keep doing repeatedly.
Title: Dismantle the Formulaic Life Content: To know what you want, focus on what is certain.Step away from formulas and the work imposed on you by others and write what you know for certain on a piece of paper:Things you want to do, places you want to go, what you are looking for in a partner, etc.
Title: Make Your Story Content: What you are certain about, is your life's calling, and nothing else matters.If you want to do something, do it even if it fails. If you want to be with a certain person, pursue that person, whatever happens. If you want to go somewhere, arrange and go, everything else can take a backseat.
