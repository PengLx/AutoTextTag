Title: Networking is necessary Content: We have to get over the belief that being competent and qualified means we shouldn't need help finding a new job.We feel this way because networking makes us feel vulnerable. We are also overconfident in a linear click-apply-send process on job sites.
Title: Networking is effective Content: Hiring managers want job candidates whom they know they can trust. That is why they prefer candidates who come through personal referrals.Referrals have a 50 percent chance of getting an interview, while non-referrals have only a 3 percent chance. Referrals or internal candidates fill up to 80 percent of jobs.
Title: How to network Content: Networking is not just talking to strangers - it is also initiating career conversations with your existing acquaintances.Keep these questions in mind: Can your siblings, neighbors, friends, hairdresser or other regular contacts describe your aspirations and particular expertise in one or two sentences? Can you explain theirs?
Title: Career conversation starters Content: Networking with the people you already know shouldn't be diffciut.Be curious about their goals first. Ask,"what's one goal you have for this year?" Most people will ask you the same question in turn. The conversations can lead to brainstorming or introductions.
