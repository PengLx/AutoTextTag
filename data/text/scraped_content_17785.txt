Title: Greater Focus Content: Be in the Now, realizing that the only available and real moment is the present moment is the best way to live. Apart from the Now, the rest is just unrealized fiction and bad memories no one cares about.To increase one’s focus on the now, we have to let go of distractions and options that hinder our thinking and create doubt and uncertainty in us.
Title: A Long Walk For Focus Content: Walking is the best way to focus on the now, and is a blessing for the whole day if done in the morning. Life is already too short, and a nice walk prolongs time and gives it space. Walking provides us with fresh air, exercise and peacefulness.
Title: The Trick Of Deciding Content: The ‘decision hack’ to increase productivity is to not have too many distractions and options to choose from. If we have a lot of actions and decisions to make in a long to-do list, every item suffers. The trick is to say yes to a few high priority items and say no to the rest.
Title: Multitasking Content: Doing more than one task at once is completely anti-productivity. It is nearly impossible to concentrate on two tasks at the same time. This way of working is inefficient for focus and deep work. If you are doing shallow work like washing the dishes, multitasking works.
Title: We Go Where We Look Content: Whatever we focus on the whole day, we become.If our plan is to become great at something, we simply need to watch what we do the entire day. If we are working towards our goal, then we will be fine. If we are watching the news and fiddling with the smartphone the entire day, we can forget about our goals.
