Title: Realize How Little You Know Content: The more you learn, the more you realize you don’t know. And that’s a humbling realization.If you want to be a learner, you have to appreciate the fact that you have much to learn. This is not false humility or some kind of feigned status. It is a mindset.
Title: Be An Apprentice Content: Excellence takes time, and to achieve it you have to adopt the mindset of an apprentice. To think like an apprentice:Watch, listen and be present in the process. Practice often instead of waiting for your Big Break.Accept that few become great on their own and learn from whoever accepts to teach.Offer to help the experienced in their missions. They will like you better and may become “patrons”.
Title: Be Someone’s Case Study Content: Master the principles your potential mentor teaches and then share with them how it made an impact on your life, sometimes that’s enough to kickstart a relationship that becomes a mentorship.This can work because you’re demonstrating that their teaching works which makes them more invested in you, as you display the value of their techniques and reputation.
