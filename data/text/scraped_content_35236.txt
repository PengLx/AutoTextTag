Title: Baby sleep  Content: If your baby is overtired and cranky from being up during the night, this will make nap training nearly impossible. That’s because a well-rested baby naps better than a sleep deprived  one. When your baby sleeps well at night and is a rested and happy baby, it’s much easier to get him napping longer too. Seems counterintuitive, but it’s true! In general, “sleeping well” means that your baby spends the majority of the night sleeping! For 6+ month olds, this means your baby either sleeps through the night or has 1-2 night feeds where he quickly falls back asleep and sleeps long stretches. Younger babies may need more night feeds, but they settle easily after. If awake times are too short  , your baby may not be tired enough and ready for a nap. If awake times are too long  , your baby may become overtired / overstimulated.
