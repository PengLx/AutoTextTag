Title: Science-Fiction As An Educational Tool Content: Science-fiction can make scientific theories more accessible to the general public, especially when communicated visually. Besides inspiring science related activities, science fiction has the capacity to fuel the creative impulses of all kinds of people, including architects, designers, and politicians.Supporting these visions of social or technological progress and sharing them with others can provide a sense of purpose in itself. And helping to cultivate the dream, increases the possibility that others will find a way to get there eventually.
Title: Science-Fiction, Connection And Hope Content: We may currently lack the technical or social capacity to reach our goals, but the vision of an eventual breakthrough breeds optimism and builds resolve serving as beacons of faith and moral bearings for how we live today.Portrayals of a better future can also inspire actions that contribute to something greater than ourselves; when we emotionally invest in mythic ideas about the future, we feel empowered to actualize them. That sense of empowerment fuels purpose and fosters global communion with the rest of humanity.
Title: Science-Fiction And Perspective Content: Science fiction can coax us to think creatively by letting us leapfrog to the distant future where we may glimpse what radical change could look like.These stories often imply that we will survive as a species and overcome our challenges or warn us that though we may progress as a society, dangers abound. A multi-generational perspective that is scaled to encompass interplanetary habitation enlarges our understanding of our context within the universe and discourages shortsighted actions while encouraging peaceful coexistence and conservation.
