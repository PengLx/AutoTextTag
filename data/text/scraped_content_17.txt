Personal Development,Communication,Motivation & Inspiration
Title: Stop Taking Things Personally Content: When people criticize you or reject you, it has way more to do with them,(their values, their priorities, their life situation) than it does with you.When something you do fails, it doesn’t mean you are a failure as a person; you are a person who happens to fail sometimes.When something tragic happens and you suffer, remember that hardship is part of choosing to live.
Title: Why we hold on to our beliefs Content: Our beliefs are not simply ideas that we hold to be true;they make up key components of our identity.And to question those beliefs means to fundamentally question who we are as a person, which is really painful.
Title: Being wrong Content: You’re going to be wrong a lot in life. You’re going to be wrong pretty much all of the time.And in many ways, your ability to succeed and learn over the long-term is directly proportional to your ability to change what you believe in response to your ignorance and mistakes.
Title: Add some chaos to your life Content: We avoid acting in uncertainty. And because we cannot act on what we don’t know, our lives become incredibly repetitive and safe.A certain amount of chaos is healthy. It stimulates growth and change and passion and excitement.
