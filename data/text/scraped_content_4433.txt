Title: Human Emotions Content: An emotion is an objective state that exhibits itself in many ways like behavior, facial expression, heart rate, blood pressure, and stress-hormone levels.Broadly speaking, we know that there are a limited number of discrete human emotions, mainly joy, anger, sadness, fear, love, hate and desire.New research on human emotions reveals that they are not isolated into fixed slots, but are fluid, subjective, and can take a cue from the way we describe them, altering themselves accordingly.
Title: New Kinds of Emotions Content: Mix N match Emotions: FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) is a newly coined mix of envy, fear, and sadness.Social Emotions: Feelings like guilt, shame and embarrassment are social emotions, and can even be found in dogs.Fear: Emotions like fear and anxiety are hard to pinpoint in the brain's geographical area, due to the presence of multiple fear circuits.If our emotions are constructed by our minds, it means they can also be de-constructed or even reconstructed.
Title: Labelling Emotions Content: The brain loves to identify, tag, or label all the feelings and emotions that are being experienced.New studies show that changing the name of the emotion can change the feeling that is produced by hearing that emotion, and the brain may be able to create or make up emotions that don't have a label yet.
