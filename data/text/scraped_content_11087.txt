Title: Building Success Content: Entire books can be completed by simply writing ‘two crappy pages a day’, but do remember that the ‘first draft of anything you write is shit!’Sudden success, if any, is a flash in the pan, and a tree whose roots aren’t deep cannot stand tall for long.

Small changes spread wide, resulting in big wins.Small tweaks in our lives, our email subject lines, our handwriting and art, decreasing our procrastination time, saving money time and energy can have an overall profound impact.
Title: Small Steps, Right Direction Content: If we stick to our rules and keep progressing in small steps, we reach our destination, if the direction is right. All we have to do is improve a little bit every day.
