Title: Intimate Relationships Content: You and your partner are best able to define what you think a successful relationship looks like.When assessing your relationship, instead of comparing it to other couples, ask: “How do we mutually contribute to making our lives better?” 
Title: Parenting Content: Instead of criticizing yourself (or your children) for not being perfect,give yourself credit for being the best parent you can be. Enjoy your children for who they are.If there are areas where you can do better,focus on those things and give them your best shot.
Title: Professional Achievements Content: You’ve worked hard to get where you are.Instead of comparing yourself to your friends and colleagues, appreciate the extent of what you have already achieved.Then, challenge yourself in the next round of your journey.
Title: Material Possessions Content: If you view material possessions as the overwhelming proof that someone is successful—maybe you’ve got it wrong.The most successful people see acquiring material possessions as benefits of the labor bargain.
Title: Happiness Content: Happiness is a subjective concept. What makes one person happy may not satisfy the next.When determining whether you are “successful,” ask yourself whether you are happy.
