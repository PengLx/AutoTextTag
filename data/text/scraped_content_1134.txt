Title: Leadership Content: Leadership is knowing how to get the most out of a team, identifying the right set of goals to complete and setting direction. In business this is also known as “vision” as it’s more about knowing what is important then how to achieve it.Good leadership assembles a competent team who share the vision regarding the goal, makes informed adjustments to it and mediates conflicts. All this while observing the ever-changing motivating forces of each team member, motivating, delegating and, when appropriate, interfering.
Title: Leadership Versus Management Content: There is no sense of providing a clear vision [leadership] if your team can’t agree and complete the tasks to achieve your goals [management] and vice versa.It is fundamental for great leaders and managers to understand the difference between the functions and not try to perform both but to attract and trust their complement.
Title: Management Content: Management is about overseeing a group to achieve an objective. A manager must define the goals of a project, break it up into tasks, assign responsibilities, measure individual & group progress and control the scope of the project to complete the work properly.Managers were true that those are not necessarily good leaders. On the other hand, good leaders who maintain moral and motivation but aren’t good managers (scope, task, quality) also don’t produce great results. That’s why good leaders and managers should be paired.
