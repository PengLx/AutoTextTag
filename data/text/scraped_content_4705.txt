Title: Redefining Happiness Content: Happiness isn't something you get when you go shopping or go on a vacation. It is a byproduct of doing something meaningful and useful. If we are not making a difference in the world by doing something worthwhile, not adding or creating anything of value, then we cannot achieve happiness just by drinking and getting high.
Title: The Little Things Content: We can do a lot of things, however small, and still make a difference. Without any grandiose aim of changing the world, even the smallest of things can help make it a better place. We can consider doing an extra-curricular activity in the office, writing a creative article and sharing it, helping someone financially, or even starting a side project that helps our locality.Just do anything useful, and leave the world a better place than it was before.
