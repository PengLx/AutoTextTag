Title: Good listening Content: Good listening doesn't follow a technique as much as being willing to enter into another person's life.Listening through the screen of your own desires means that you are listening to your own voice and desires. It is the same as not listening at all.Listening demands wiping the slate of your mind clean.
Title: Not knowing what to say Content: Not knowing what to say when someone confides in you is a daunting feeling. However, we feel that way because we mistakenly think the person reaching out is asking for an explanation.It is more important just to be there, so the other person doesn't feel alone.
Title: Inability to listen to yourself Content: People who have not been listened to often find it hard to listen to themselves. They struggle to make sense of their inner world. When people are forced to muffle their feelings and thoughts, they are in danger of burying those inner perturbations so deeply that they can't dig them up again.
