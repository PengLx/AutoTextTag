Title: Fear of abandonment Content: Fear of abandonment can come from childhood loss or neglect as a child, especially if it is more emotional.Brain development is the process of creating, strengthening, and discarding connections among the neurons. The growth of each region of the brain depends largely on receiving stimulation. By not attending to that stimulation, your body can't function properly. The remedy to fear of abandonment in your relationship is to work on exercising that "attachment muscle," allowing yourself to become more vulnerable and open with your partner.
Title: Inability to commit to your partner Content: Studies showed that the experiences as a baby within the first three years of life lay the foundation for how the brain is wired well into adulthood.However, it is possible to "re-learn" things as adults and change the framework of our brains this way. If you are committed to your partner but fear the "label," consider how you view attachment, dedication, and loyalty in relationships.
Title: Entitlement Content: Entitlement is an unrealistic, unmerited or inappropriate expectation of favorable living conditions and treatment by others. It is a selfish quality.People act entitled in relationships because they are overcompensating for never getting what they want or are comfortable in always getting what they want.
Title: Feelings of worthlessness Content: There are 4 different kinds of parenting styles that can lead to your child feeling worthless or defective.Authoritarian parents: they want their children to obey rules but have little time to listen to their child's feelings or needs.Permissive parents: They are too laid back and may let children "fend for themselves," making children feel they are not worthy of their parent's time.Narcissistic parents: They feel as though the world and their children revolve around them, placing their own needs and desires above those of their children.Perfectionist parents: They always think their children need to do better, making their children feel inadequate even after accomplishing something good.
