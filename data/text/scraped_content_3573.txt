Title: Critical thinkers need the knowledge first Content: Employers need critical thinkers, but they cannot find them. Focussing on knowledge only in college does not seem to help. Neither does it help to only focus on intellectual and cognitive skills.Critical thinking is learning how to use knowledge.
Title: The focus of skills over knowledge Content: Considering the K-12 system, we see that the emphasis on skills over content has changed the curriculum. Students increasingly focus on learning skills, but they may not learn too much history or science. Critical thinking is not enough on its own. It needs to be used to gain insight from studying meaningful subject matter, like history or economics or physics or chemistry.
Title: Critical Thinking Content: Critical thinking is a disciplined activity. It is not something we can acquire without intensive study and practice, nor can we isolate it from knowledge. Knowledge is foundational to provide the structure to do deep thinking.Only with some background knowledge, can we apply the skills of critical thinking to problems and texts, understand the strengths and weaknesses of arguments, and offer creative solutions.
