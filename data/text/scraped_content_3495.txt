Title: The imposter Content:  True mindfulness has been spoiled by an imposter. The imitation provides an excuse to be self-centered and self-indulgent. It promises health and spiritual purity.
Title: Definition of mindfulness Content: Mindfulness is the nonjudgemental awareness of the richness, subtlety and variety of the present moment, not just of the self. It is not the same as meditation, although meditation can form part of it.Mindfulness acknowledges every moment of existence, good and bad. It is used to stand still in the moment, reflect and gain perspective.
Title: Mindfulness is a limited tool Content: Gazing inward to focus on a connection with yourself cannot deliver magical benefits.Acknowledging your thoughts is not the same as cherishing them.While mindfulness has some usefulness, we should also realize the benefits when we lose self-awareness, for example when we are in a state of flow.
