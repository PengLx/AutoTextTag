Title: Having 'everything' Content: We think once we have a fulfilling job, we'll be happy, or once we have a loving partner or children, we'll never feel dissatisfied again.Yet, when we have all these things, we still feel negative and sad.
Title: Hiding from yourself Content: Pretending you’re normal and trying to fit in with the innocents in your midst keeps you sad and negative.Don't stigmatize your dissatisfaction or restlessness. Don't scold yourself for your feelings, but make more space for them. These sensations will lead you down a new path toward joy.
Title: Converse with your negative self Content: Try inviting your sad and negative self to find out why you feel this way. You won’t know what you truly want until you listen patiently to yourself. If you give it time, you'll find out what you really long for.Sometimes, it is something about the way you've structured your days that doesn't honor the potential and countless possibilities that are stretched out before you. Or something about your anxiety has caused you to build things that restrict you. Your fears will keep you inside predictable shapes.
Title: Make some room for yourself Content: A wrong view of yourself can sometimes cloud your understanding of who you are. Thinking you are not enough, you’re doing it wrong, you're making a mess, will make you feel misunderstood and unimportant.You feel this way because you treat yourself this way.Make some room for yourself. Clear a path for your desires.
