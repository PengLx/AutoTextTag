Title: Compulsive shopping Content: A preoccupation with shopping for unneeded items, taking you away from daily responsibilities such as work duties and home life.Spending much of your time shopping or doing intense research on items you wish to buy.Extreme difficulty resisting the urge to purchase something, even if it's not needed or desired.An elevated sense of self-worth or euphoria when making purchases.Continuing a shopping spree or unnecessary purchasing despite negative consequences such as debt or financial trouble.Problems at work or with loved ones due to your uncontrollable shopping urges.Deep satisfaction and calm state after making a purchase.
Title: A neurological explanation Content: Up to 6% of the population suffers from shopping compulsion or addiction.When you consider a new purchase, you're anticipating a reward.Once the purchase is made, the reward pathway of your brain lights up, and dopamine floods your system. Once it wears off, you crave it again.That is why it makes sense that we shop for celebrating and for feeling good.
