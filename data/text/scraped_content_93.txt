PrioritizeDo not carry a cellphone 24/7Do not expect work to fill a void that non-work relationships and activities should.
Title: Prioritizing important stuff Content: If you define the single most important task for each day, almost nothing else seems urgent or important. The answer to overwhelm is not spinning more plates — or doing more — it’s defining the few things that can really fundamentally change your life.
Title: Work is not all of life Content: Do not expect work to fill a void that non-work relationships and activities should.Your co-workers shouldn’t be your only friends. Schedule life and defend it just as you would an important business meeting.
Title: Meetings with unclear agendas Content: If the desired outcome is defined clearly with a stated objective and agenda listing topics/questions to cover, no meeting or call should last more than 30 minutes.Request them in advance so you can best prepare and make good use of the time together.
