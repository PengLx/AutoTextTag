Title: Challenge your preconceived notions Content: Be willing toaccept the inherent risk in not following what seemed to be the obvious route. Such risk tolerance is another important part of challenging what you think you know and cultivating creativity.If you’re always afraid to try new things because they might not work, you’re going to have a tough time cultivating your more creative side.
Title: Plan Creativity-Stoking Sessions Content: Create vision boards–collages of words and images–related to business challenges or goals. Do mind-mapping or doodling exercises.You will begin making remote associations.It can be hard and it’s a stretch, but it opens up new ways of thinking.
Title: Change up routine regularly Content: When you’re facing down something unexpected, you’re taken out of your everyday experience and all of the preconceived notions that go with it.Do something new every day to capture the same openness. Take a new route home and carefully observe what’s there. Look for beauty, interesting architecture, or exceptional gardens. Remember how it feels to be truly observant and unsure of what to expect.
Title: Find What Creates Mind Space For You Content: When you’re focused on external stimuli, you’re giving your mind some “breathing room” to come up with creative solutions.By focusing on something you find beautiful, you’ve taken the pressure off of figuring out the immediate problem at hand. And it can be tough to be creative under pressure.
