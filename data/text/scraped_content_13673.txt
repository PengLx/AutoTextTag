Title: The Rules Of Sorry Content: Accept Responsibility.Acknowledge harm and suffering that you may have caused.Do make a promise of future correction of the mistake.Be sincere.Make an offer of an immediate remedy.Don't forget to include the words ‘sorry’ or ‘apologize’.
Title: The Gratitude Trick Content: A recent study in a marketing journal advises to use gratitude, and start with a note of thanks towards what has been endured by the recipient.For Example, Saying “Thank you for your patience’ instead of ‘Sorry for the wait’.
Title: Explanations and Excuses Content: ... along with justifications is all we normally blurt out during a heated discussion or argument, and it just makes things worse. Focus on the present and the future, and not try to justify the past. 
Title: Apology Is Complicated Content: An apology is useless if spoken too soon. It is important to first let the grieving party speak their minds.For public figures, the sincerity of the apology is trickier, as their public apology (to a grieving party or family member) may sound good to the world but may not be enough for the recipient.
Title: The ‘Apology Gift’ Content: While apologizing, a certain cost has to be paid up. The point of this cost is not to benefit or enrich the recipient of the ‘Apology Gift’ but the sacrifice or the hurt the giver is willing to undergo. For Example, an offer to cancel a weekend trip in order to spend that time with the partner.
