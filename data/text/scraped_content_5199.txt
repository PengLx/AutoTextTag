Title: Create project for my coding learning Content: Remember to save a slot for one of the most important goals: the personal project. For me, it's one of the most essential things in coding. If you want to succeed and stay motivated, you should create projects.But you don't always have to finish them. The idea is to achieve small goals in your projects.I'll give you an example. If you want to learn how to use a database, you can start a blog project. But if your interest is just learning how to add something to a database, you can create a simple form (a title and description) to add a record to the database.
