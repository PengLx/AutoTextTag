Title: The Universal Formula for Doing Big Things Content: Find the MVM and focus on it.
Title: Minimum Viable Motivator Content: The thing that will give you a rush of accomplishment when you complete it, and make you want to keep going the next day. It's a miniaturized version of your goal.When you complete your MVM, you feel a thrill that’s similar to the one you’d get if you had achieved your end goal.
Title: How to focus on the MVM Content: Take a big, daunting goal and break it up into smaller parts. Choose distinct and simple actions that, when put together, will build a desired habit. Make sure each action seems either easy or pleasurable enough to you that you won’t use, “It’s too hard” as an excuse not to do it. Your MVM might seem stupidly simple to you — for instance, if you are trying to build a reading habit, you might set a goal to read for five minutes straight.Once you complete your MVM, you’re done, even if you think you could do a bit more. Save that enthusiasm; it will come in handy to keep you motivated tomorrow.Celebrate! This is an important step. After achieving each MVM, act as if you have achieved the entire goal. You’re a runner! You’re a reader! After all, you’re not wrong; you took the necessary step today. Don’t cheat yourself by dwelling on the fact that there’s still more to do.After a while, you can adjust the difficulty of the tasks, and build habits. If your MVMs seem to be getting too taxing, make them a bit easier for a while. The point is to outsmart yourself.
