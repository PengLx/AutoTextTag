Title: “Positive” Procrastination Content: At the top of your to-do list, put a couple of daunting, if not impossible, tasks that are vaguely important-sounding (but really aren’t) and seem to have deadlines (but really don’t).Then, farther down the list, include some doable tasks that really matter.
Title: Dashes Content: Adashis simplya short burst of focused activity during which you force yourself to do nothing but work on the procrastinated item for averyshort period of time—perhaps as little as just one minute.The first thing is to takeone minuteand justwrite down the steps you need to do to finish the task - just a rough draft, at first, and that’s it.Now there is nothing else to think about, and there is no way to screw this task up. Everything is laid out and you can just start working on it.
Title: Commitment Devices Content: First, give your friend $100. If you get the task done by 5 PM, you get your $100 back. If it doesn’t, you lose the $100.Or make it $200 that the friend doesn’t keep — they donate it to some weird organizations, in your name.Get the picture? That’s a commitment device.
Title: Improve your mood Content: If you’re really going to be motivated, you need to feel something. Having a rational goal in mind or thinking you want something just isn’t enough.What moves you? What inspires you? Try that.
