Title: Growth Mindset = the pr Content: Let's get to it...Carol Dweck is a researcher at Stanford University.Dweck is well-known for her work on "the fixed mindset vs. the growth mindset." Here's how Dweck describes the difference between these two mindsets and how they impact your performance...In a fixed mindset students believe their basic abilities, their intelligence, their talents, are just fixed traits. They have a certain amount and that's that, and then their goal becomes to look smart all the time and never look dumb. In a growth mindset students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and persistence. They don't necessarily think everyone's the same or anyone can be Einstein, but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it. -Carol Dweck, Stanford University
