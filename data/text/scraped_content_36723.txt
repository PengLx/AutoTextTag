Title: Why anxiety exists Content: The piano at the lesson is different to the one practised on. It will feel different, sound different, and respond differently. This can take quite an adjustment.They are playing for somebody who is a far more advanced musician, and can feel daunted that all their imperfections will be so obviously on display.They may be disappointed that they haven’t been able to practise more since the previous lesson, even thought that might be for a variety of (usually very good) reasons .They are outside their comfort zone. For the adult student who typically functions in a role of authority, working with a teacher can be particularly odd – and the teacher can also find this situation takes an adjustment.They may fear harsh criticism, or be comparing themselves negatively with other students. Adults often tell me they “realise that I teach young children who are better than them…”They may simply not be enjoying the piece they are working on.
Title: One single reason... Content: However, I would suggest that the single most common reason pupils can be anxious attending a lessons is that they CARE about doing well.
Title: The solution Content: 1:Don’t be surprised or put off by anxiety in lessons.  2: Allow private time for warming up  3:Start lessons with warm ups (perhaps includingPiano Qigong ) and finger exercises such as scales, arpeggios, and other studies.  4: Revise well-known and loved previous repertoire.
