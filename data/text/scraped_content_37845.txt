Title:  Content: When my clients want to focus on their goals in therapy, I challenge them to ask this question first: “How do I make decisions every day?” Because if you’re relying on your relationships or the internet for your definition of success, then you’re not bringing very much of yourself — your own thinking, your own values — to whatever you’re trying to accomplish.
Title:  Content: To help my therapy clients learn to wean themselves off of other people’s validation, I ask them to come up with one or two questions they want to use every day to guide their thinking. How would I like to be responsible for myself today ?If I could only complete one task today, what would it be?What would be solid evidence that I was productive today?Is there any important relationship I’d like to strengthen today?This practice also can help you be more objective about how you’re doing, so you won’t have to constantly ask others for reassurance.
