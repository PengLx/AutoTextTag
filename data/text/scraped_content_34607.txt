Title: A Human Android Is Creepy Content: If robots act like mechanisms to get the job done, like a printer, for example, human minds are at ease. When the cognitive mechanisms start to accurately resemble actual living and breathing humans, humans enter an uncanny valley, a creepy sensation about something not being right.
Title: Humanize, Dehumanize Content: Humans feel this way because at first, their mind tells them this thing they are talking to is alive, conscious and has a mind, but then it tells them that it does not.This two-step process, beginning with anthropomorphizing an android, and then dehumanizing it in the blink of an eye, is what leads to unease.
