Productivity
Title: The Evolution Of "Productivity" Content: Back in the Industrial Revolution context, productivity was translated into the amount of production per factory or per worker for a given day.These days the discussion revolves more about personal productivity and it relates to how much work we can get done in the smallest amount of time possible.
Title: The Productivity Equation Content: Productivity = Useful Output/Time x Fun FactorThe more output we generate, the more productive we are; also the less time it takes to generate it, the more productive we are. But we should give our energy the useful things - there no point in being productive if we are not productive about the right things. And when your tasks are fun, they no longer feel like work.
Title: The Fun Factor In The Productivity Equation Content: It's very important to make our productive tasks enjoyable.When the activities we are focusing on are pleasant to us, the fun factor influences our outputs and the the time we take to make them. Plus, we no longer have to worry about motivation, consistency, willpower and discipline.
Title: A Mental Model For Productivity Content: The plane, pilot, engineer analogy - these are the roles we play in a day:On pilot mode (10-15% of our time): This represents the time of the day the when we have clarity and we decide where we want to go. The pilot sets the course/ the direction of the plane.On plane mode (80%of our time): This is us most of the time, executing instruction from the pilot mode. The plane follows the course and directions from the pilot, without deviation.On engineer mode (5-10% of our time): This is the time we take to consider the use of principles, tools and methods to keep everything efficient. The engineer makes sure the engine is efficient (using the right amount of energy) and keeps the entire system organized;
