Communication
Title: Effective communicators rely on structure Content: People will retain structured information up to 40% more accurately than information that is presented without structure.Having a clear structure for communicating helps you in 2 ways: it allows you to organize and remember your ideas, and it makes it easier for your listener to follow and stay focused.
Title: The 3-I's: Issue, Illustration, Invitation Content: Outline your issue or explain your idea in simple terms.Use an illustration to expound on your main point - it canbe funny or inspirational stories, jokes, metaphors, or analogies.Give an invitation, a way in which your listener is able to respond. Your goal is to throw the ball into your listener’s court. It can be as simple as “What do you think?”
Title: The 3-Ws: What? So what? Now what? Content: Define your key idea or argument concisely. You should be able to boil it down to one sentence, or two at most.The “So what?” forces you to answer the question of why the issue should matter to your audience. Explain how your listeners will be affected if they don’t respond to the issue. Make use of research or evidence.The “Now what?” is where you give your listener a concrete way to move forward to the next immediate step.
Title: PSB: Problem, solution, benefit Content: Begin with presenting the problem, a clear point of frustration.Present your well-thought-out solution to the problem.The “Benefit” is typically indirect and should not require much emphasis. Your audiences’ response should come naturally as a result of you presenting the “Solution” well enough.Their response and perceived benefit will be equal to the quality of your solution.
