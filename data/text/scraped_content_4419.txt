Title: The Art of Telling Stories Content: Today, brand perceptions and relationships are increasingly difficult to maintain, due to constraints of limited budgets, a whole lot of options, and audiences who are distracted, disinterested and skeptical.Reciting endless facts and figures cannot hold the audience interest or ensure any recall, as an authentic story can.A story intrigues us, gets us involved and makes our mind communicate silently with the storyteller. It can break through any distractions, change our perception, inspire us, and generate lasting memories.
Title: Facts Mean Nothing Content: The assumption that the audience will logically look at the facts and figures and make the right choice is fundamentally flawed. Audiences ignore most factual data, which even if repeated often, is forgotten or distorted.
Title: An Impactful Story Content: Even when brands know the value of communicating through stories, it is hard to create truly powerful narratives.An impactful story usually involves empathetic and authentic people overcoming challenges, which can inspire, entertain and inform audiences.
Title: Presentation Matters Content: How a good story is presented to the audience matters.Brands who don't take professional help in communicating stories end up with a confusing, badly edited and incoherent narrative that is a put-off.Detailed stories with vivid examples can intrigue the audience, leading to successful communication.
Title: Mismanaged Programs Content: Mismanaged story platforms, disconnected programs and teams with conflicting guidelines can botch up a good story. If there are too many stories, the impact is diluted.Having a signature story, which is integrated, coherent and authentic can make organizations avoid these four pitfalls and find success in their brand communication.
