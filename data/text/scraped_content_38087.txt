Title: A cultural endorsement of love Content: Love is often seen as the exciting feeling we get in the presence of someone with great intelligence of beauty that we hope will reciprocate our interest and whom we badly want to touch and one day share our lives with.But there is another definition of love that is not so much focused on the appreciation of strength as on the tolerance of, and kindness towards, the weak and misshapen.
Title: Love is focused on the other person Content: This type of love is displayed when we come across the itinerant drunk - weather-beaten and ranting - and do not turn away but consider them as a version of ourselves, falling prey to the same passions and getting upset by similar losses and worthy of their own share of compassion.We also show love to the well-dressed person shouting grandly at an airport, filled with self-righteousness, and do not dismiss them as insane or entitled, but as vulnerable beneath the bluster.We show love when we see a small child throwing themselves on the floor, and do not focus on how piercing their screams are, but that their pain is in its general form ours too.It is love too when our partner is sometimes plainly irrational, unfair, and maddening, and we do not direct back a full dose of righteous anger but hold back and wonder how this formerly sane adult should have fallen apart in this manner. It is to hold open the idea that they might not have slept very well, are perhaps panicked by the future, and don't understand how to master it.
Title: Love for the weak Content: It is no particular accomplishment to love someone who is on their best behavior.What is needed for our attention is the love of what is crooked, damaged, and self-disgusted. Here love is the effort required to imagine oneself into the life of another person who has not made it easy to admire or like them.
Title: The spirit of love Content: Nothing is more important than the love that rescues nations from intolerance, which slows wars, calms furies, and allows civilisation to continue. True love is not giving someone what their due is, but what they need in order to survive.True love acknowledges how much we may one day stand in need of this form of love. Perhaps we may become people who know how to love properly. We may make an effort to extend love to others who have themselves failed so that society can become a less frightening place for all.
