Title: Make time for it Content: Unless you schedule reading time in your busy day, you may not be able to squeeze it anywhere between all of the other tasks already crowding the calendar.Even if you can only devote 15 minutes for reading— the time it takes you to commute to work— do put it in your schedule.
Title: Book bags everywhere Content: Carrying a book with you at all times is a great trick to start reading more habitually.You will find that there are a lot of times where you can read a chapter or two, such as instead of staring at your computer screen or checking your email for the 15th time.
Title: Make a reading list Content: Do a bit of research if you don’t know where to start or if your previous choices of authors have been uninspiring.Create a list with exciting books and stories – just don’t overdo it. Anything beyond 20 books for an entire year could be too overwhelming if you’re just getting started as a dedicated reader.
Title: Know when to give up a book Content: If you find yourself stressing out (or yawning!) over a difficult or boring book, do give it a try for a few more pages but give up if it ends up frustrating you.
Title: Get excited about the book Content: Read a review or two online to see what people are saying and raving about or try reading the first few pages of the content and the back-cover blurb to get an idea of the narrative.This will make you look forward to reading the book by sparking your curiosity about “what happens next.”
Title: Read to someone Content: A great way to get into reading more is to read to someone else: an elderly person or a shut-in, a friend’s child or your own son or daughter.You willhave a reading assignment that helps you stick to your reading habit.
