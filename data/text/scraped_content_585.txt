Title: Mindfulness at work Content: Means being consciously present in what you’re doing, while you’re doing it, as well as managing your mental and emotional state.If you’re writing a report, mindfulness requires you to give that your full attention. 
Title: 1 min/session Content: That’s the minimum required for a mini-mediation.Just focus on your sense. You don’t need to close your eyes. You don’t even need to be sitting down.
Title: Use Mindful Reminders Content: You can use interruptions as hooks to make you more mindful.Every time your phone rings, take a mindful breath. Every time you hear the ping of a text message, pause to be mindful of your surroundings rather than immediately reacting by checking the message.
Title: The negativity bias Content: You’re much more likely to focus and dwell on something that’s gone wrong than on things that have gone well.Behaving in this way every day means that you ultimately adopt an excessively negative and unbalanced way of thinking.Gratitude is the antidote.
Title: Adopting a Growth Mindset Content: You expect and move towards challenges, seeing them as opportunities for inner growth.You don’t mind getting negative feedback as you view it as a chance to discover something new.You don’t mind taking on new responsibilities because you’re curious about how you’ll cope.
