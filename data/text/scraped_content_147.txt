Title: Knowing things Content: There is no inherent value in knowledge of a fact.Two things are far more important than what you know: What you can learn, and what you know you don’t need to know.
Title: Identifying what doesn't matter Content: The most valuable skill for success in diverse circumstances might be the ability to quickly identify what doesn’t matter.Discern what is not of fundamental importance and ignore it.
Title: Humility and self-confidence Content: Successful peopleknow what they don’t need to know and they don’t waste effort trying to learn it.But most people feel pressure to know a lot of useless stuff because it will save them the embarrassment of ever appearing to not know something.
Title: The 80/20 rule reversed Content: Sometimes figuring out your 20% — what activities you will get the vast majority of your return on — is too hard.It’s sometimes easier to identify the 80% of things not bringing you sufficient value and stop learning and doing them.
