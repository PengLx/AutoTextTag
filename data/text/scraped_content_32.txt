Title: Acting upon your ideas Content: Results come to those who act upon their plans, not to those that spend most of their time seeking the right way to do it.When it comes to goals, projects, and other to-do items, it’s easy to get stuck too long in the thinking and planning phase. And unfortunately, most of them will never be done.
Title: Being a Doer Content: This requires a lot of discipline, commitment and risk-taking, but it's the only way to make progress.If you are not daring and focused enough, you can never get past the “thinking” stage of getting work done.
Title: Embracing the action habit Content: Actions you take beat life-changing intentions. Not doing anything is the same as intending to do something but never actually doing it.Also, thinking about doing something is more exhausting than doing.
