Title: Your resolve Content: The secret to effectively setting and achieving your goals is to have a large vision and an achievable plan.
Title: The pursuit matters Content: The pursuit matters just as much as the goal.Consider why you're pursuing your goal and how the journey to achieve it will help you grow as a person.
Title: The right scope Content: People often give up on their resolutions because they set unattainable goals.Try to set a goal that you can reasonably achieve within one year. If it is challenging to complete it in your set timeframe, you might become overwhelmed and give up. If the goal will take more than one year, try and set a benchmark for what you'd like to accomplish in a year.
Title: Focus on what you want Content: Don't focus on what you don't want. If you are unsure how to identify the core of your goal, do something physical to minimize getting depressed over it.Reframe your mindset so you're not being guided by fear, but facing it head-on.
Title: Don't stop Content: Once you've achieved your goal, don't stop.  Without another goal to pursue, you will feel lost. When you are nearing your goal, fit in the next ones; otherwise, there will be a drop in energy, and you will feel stagnant.
