Title: A system is... Content:  Something you do on a regular basis that increases your odds of success regardless of the immediate outcome.A collection of goals, tools, habits, and methods is not the same as a purposeful system. A working system allows you to reduce your tasks to a manageable set of inputs and outputs, and establish some predictability.
Title: Systems vs. goals Content: If you do something every day, it’s a system. If you’re waiting to achieve it someday in the future, it’s a goal.
Title: To build an effective system... Content: Take yourself mentally from step one all the way to the final step. At each step, ask yourself what tools, resources, information, or people you might need access to. Put them in a designated space or build in the easiest possible method for getting what you need when you need it. As part of the system, plan a regular time to restock the consumable resources that the system requires.
