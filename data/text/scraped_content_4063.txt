Love & Relationships
Title: The People Pleaser Content: It's the person that feels that most of the time there is no other option but to adjust to the expectations of others, and yet harbors a lot of hidden resentment.This is a dangerous path: they end up confusing everyone around them by failing to express their true needs and feelings and they also build up a lot of frustration.
Title: A Type Of Lie Content: People-pleasing is essentially a form of lying.And we do it not to obtain some sort of advantage over someone, but because we deeply fear the annoyance and dissatisfaction of the people around us.
Title: Origins Of People Pleasing Content: It is related to being around people (usually our parents) who seem to have a really hard time and even be unable to accept and forgive some odd but sometimes necessary facts about their child.To survive, we decide to be responsive to what others expect us to do and be, leaving aside what we really want.
Title: Love And Fear Content: We don't always lie out of fear. We may see people-pleasing as a form of love, for someone whom we perceive to be vulnerable (to keep them in a good mood or to avoid adding another burden to their life).
Title: Stop Being a People Pleaser Content: Keep in mind that the people that now in adulthood surround you (colleagues, friends, partners) are most likely very different from the ones that influenced your anxieties during childhood.Be aware of the side effects of people-pleasing: even if you have good intentions, you are in fact creating problems by not speaking up more frequently.You can learn to reframe the way you deliver your messages, especially when it comes to difficult, sensitive topics.
