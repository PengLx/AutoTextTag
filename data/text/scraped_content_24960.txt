Title: Everybody has an inner critic Content: Our inner critic is the voice from inside our heads, that always puts us under a microscope.Its "job" is to find and accentuate our failures.
Title: You canâ€™t get rid of your inner critic Content: But it is in your power to develop a relationship with it.Think of your inner critic as a part of you, not all of you. This gives you distance from it and keeps you from attacking yourself.
Title: Personifying Confidence Content: Give to the voice of Confidence more of the time you were giving to your inner Critic, letting it acknowledge your accomplishments and positive qualities.You can try imagining Confidence sitting across from you in a chair, as you listen to what it has to say.
