Title: Emotions are present at all times Content: Most emotions arise unconsciously as ways of adapting to changes in the environment or in our own mind.We are emotional beings and there is no experience that does not receive the impact, softer or more intense, of our affective life.
Title: The loss of emotional regulation brings: Content: Non-acceptance of emotional response (reacting to the expression of emotion)Difficulty to commit to planned goals (by the irruption of afflictive emotion)Difficulty in controlling impulses (not being able to inhibit)Lack of emotional awareness (not being able to name it, label it)Limited access to emotional regulation strategies (not knowing how to regain control over afflictive emotion)Lack of emotional clarity (not being able to discern the emotions that appear)Mindfulness can bring improvements in all of these facets.
Title: Afflictive emotions Content: Within the universe of Mindfulness (following Buddhism), these areemotions that arise in reaction to an experience of displeasure or discomfort in our life, and that make us react without more control of the mind. Afflictive emotions are not the basic ones of our human condition, like fear, anguish or the most primary anger, but what we do with them.
