Title: The power of habit tracking: Content: It creates a visual cue that can remind you to act.It is motivating to see the progress you are making. You don't want to break your streak.It feels satisfying to record your success in the moment.
Title: To make habit tracking easier: Content: Manual tracking should be limited to your most important habits.Record each measurement immediately after the habit occurs.
Title: When your habits break down Content: The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing one day in keeping a habit is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.
