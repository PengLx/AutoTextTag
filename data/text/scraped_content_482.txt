Title: Sticking to a healthy lifestyle Content: Staying in shape is mostly about program compliance.It’s not about having the best fitness program, but about having one that’s good enough, eating less junk food  and making sure you actually stick to it.And most people have trouble doing that.
Title: Off limits foods Content: Successful dieters usually declare certain foods to be completely out of bounds, or allowed only during occasional designated cheat meals, rather than expecting themselves to eat everything in moderation.
Title: Saying no to bad habits Content: It might seem like a simple matter of self-control. But it turns out that people with high self-control may not necessarily be better at resisting temptation. They might just experience it less often in the first place.
Title: "Have to" and "Want to" goals Content: Have to” goals are set externally  ( e.g.: a doctor tells you that you should lose weight) and may be moreeffortful to reach;“Want to” goals are the ones you feel internally motivated to accomplish  (you do your workout because you love how it makes you feel) and usually don't need as much self-control.
Title: The Instagram Effect and food porn Content: Counterintuitively, you’d be better off viewing photos of junk food, instead of healthy food, becauseviewing the photos induces satiety, decreasing the desire for and enjoyment of foods of the type shown in the photos.
