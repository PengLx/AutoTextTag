Title: Idea 1 Content: Scientists have discovered a new organ: a set of salivary glands set deep in the upper part of the throat.
Title: Idea 2 Content: The discovery was accidental. Researchers at the Netherlands Cancer Institute were using a combination of CT scans  and positron emission tomography (PET) scans called PSMA PET-CT to study prostate cancer  . In PSMA PET-CT scanning, doctors inject a radioactive "tracer" into the patient. This tracer binds well to the protein PSMA, which is elevated in prostate cancer cells. Clinical trials have found  that PSMA PET-CT scanning is better than conventional imaging at detecting metastasized prostate cancer.PSMA PET-CT scanning also happens to be very good at detecting salivary gland tissue, which is also high in PSMA. Until now, there were three known large salivary glands in humans: one under the tongue, one under the jaw and one at the back of the jaw, behind the cheek. Beyond those, perhaps a thousand microscopic salivary glands are scattered throughout the mucosal tissue of the throat and mouth, study co-author and Netherlands Cancer Institute radiation oncologist Wouter Vogel said in a statement  .
