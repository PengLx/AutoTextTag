Title: Less communication might be beneficial Content: So many people across the world are now working remotely. They may be concerned about the loss of regular facetime with their team.But the latest psychological literature suggests that constant collaboration can reduce 'collective intelligence.' Less communication might actually be more beneficial to a team's joint problem-solving ability.
Title: Group communication Content: In a 2015 study, researchers found that more communication in a group results in the team members quickly converging on a consensus without really exploring alternatives.In less well-connected groups, team members suffered a bit with information gathering but were less likely to reach a consensus too quickly. Each member built on their own theories, which resulted in a greater diversity of ideas.
Title: Alone time Content: Researchers tested how the rhythm of our communication can influence our problem-solving. The participants were divided into three groups.Groups with continuous interaction had a good average performance, but the team members tended to conform to mediocre solutions.People working independently didn't have the opportunity to benefit from other's solutions.The intermittent communication group was the best of both worlds. They could build on the diversity of the ideas that were created independently.
Title: Short, intense communication Content: Research showed that teams working with short "bursts" of communication, followed by longer periods of silence, performed better than less intense conversations extended over a long time.Short but intense communication helps to maintain momentum and motivation and create feelings of enthusiasm.
