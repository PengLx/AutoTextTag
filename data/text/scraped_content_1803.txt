Title: First impressions matter Content: Studies agree that you have less than 30 seconds to impress someone. Some studies even state that you have only seven seconds before someone makes a judgement.You’ve got a lot to pack into those seven seconds to make your impression a positive one.
Title: Show confidence in your body language Content: When you’re nervous, it shows in the way you’re standing or what you’re doing with your hands. The same goes for when you’re confident. Standing tall and making eye contact shows confidence.If you need a quick boost of confidence, take a power pose. One great power pose is the wonder woman – your hands on your hips, legs out in a V shape, shoulders and back straight, and chin slightly up.
Title: Be aware of the way you speak Content: Speak clearly and with an even tone. Nottoo loud or too quiet, as you could come across as dominating or shy.Using filler words such as ‘um’ or ‘so’ or filling in gaps with ‘like’ or ‘you know’ will make you seem less knowledgeable. Pay special attention to your usage of the word ‘like’.If you need time to compose your thoughts, simply pause, or restate the question.
Title: Put your phone away Content: It indicates that you don’t care about what’s currently happening and you aren’t fully committed or engaged.Unless you need your phone to demonstrate something, it should not be in your hand.
Title: Dress to impress Content: Know the appropriate way to dress so you won’t be underdressed or overdressed.Your clothes should fit well and not be wrinkled. Invest in a work-appropriate bag or backpack as well. Shoes simply need to be professional.A good rule of thumb is no open-toed shoes, sleeveless dresses, or clothes that are baggy.
Title: Be on time Content: Being late always equals a bad first impression and is one of the hardest mistakes to recover from.When in doubt, show up early.
