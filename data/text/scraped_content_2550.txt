We think we must work harder and longer than the majority if we’re to amass a fortune so we can escape the drudgery of work as we know it.We can fill our days with work that stretches us, fulfills us, and endows life with a whole new level of meaning. 
Title: Productivity and Effectiveness Content: Efficiency does not necessarily guarantee effectiveness. Getting more done is not an accurate barometer for measuring your impact.Consider whether you’re being effective in achieving what you actually want.Think about what it is you’re really seeking and what might be the most direct path to get it. Then realize that sometimes doing less can actually pave the path to experiencing more—more satisfaction, more ease, and even more effectiveness.

It would benefit us to shift our focus from achieving future happiness to accessing that joy right now.When we wrap our days around things we have to do we leave very little time for the things we want to do. Happiness requires balance.
