Title: Business chemistry Content: This is a framework for understanding meaningful differences in people’s working styles. It identifies four primary types:Pioneers, who value possibilities and spark energy and imaginationGuardians, who value stability and bring order and rigorDrivers, who value challenge and generate momentumIntegrators, who value connection and draw teams together
Title: Why universal approaches don't work Content: A one-size-fits-all approach won’t work well on a team with a mix of types.For example, too many constraints can completely shut a Pioneer down, while a Guardian may withdraw in an environment that feels too chaotic.A Driver may become very frustrated in an organization that lacks decisiveness, while an Integrator may wither on a team that doesn’t value broad-based input.
Title: Business chemistry mix Content: Manage the team in ways that support the diverse needs of different types of work.You wouldn’t want a team that is all about creative ideas with no focus on implementing those ideas. Or one that is searching for the big win with no attention paid to the people involved in getting there.
Title: Business chemistry is primarily about how you prefer to work Content:  It’s not about who you are or what you can and cannot do.We can all flex in the short-term, stretching outside our comfort zone in quick bursts, and we can all grow in the long-term, expanding that comfort zone through experience and practice.
Title: The Business chemistry mindset Content: Start by being aware of the differences between people that come from approaching things from diverse perspectives. Sometimes the root cause of a particularly challenging relationship suddenly becomes clear when you look at it through this lens.
