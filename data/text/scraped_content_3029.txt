Title: Organize your inbox  Content: Even though email messaging has provided us with better communication, we have a hard time managing every message that enters our inbox.Finding better ways to organize your inbox will benefit your productivity.
Title: Marking Emails Unread Content: Trying to locate an email you want to respond to can be very time-consuming.Mark the email you want to respond to later as "unread." It is easier to find between all your other messages.
Title: Stick to a Routine Content: Getting out of the habit of checking email frequently can be tough.Check and respond to emails twice a day at a specific time. The rest of the day you can be dedicated to your work and not lose focus because of incoming messages.
Title: Get Some Help Content: Hire someone to organize your inbox.This person will be responsible for cleaning up your inbox, forwarding very important emails, removing spam, and even replying.
Title: Acknowledge Receipt Content: An acknowledgment of receipt will lower emails because fewer people will hound you for a response.
Title: Email Applications Content: Use a smart app to manage your email messages.Set up filters that segment messages as they arrive. Each time you log in, check the important folder right away and give these emails priority.
