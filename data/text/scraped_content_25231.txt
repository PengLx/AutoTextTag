Title:  Content: Do you know the difference between passive and active datasets for ONA? In the practical online training course How to Use Python for Organisational Network Analysis Bennet Voorhees outlines the basics of organisational network analysis, what it is and why you should do one. He takes you through the necessary steps of how to use Python to understand collaboration, networks and key influencers within your organisation as well as how to build network graphs and to visualise relationships.In this short bitesized learning video, taken from the course, Bennet helps us understand the difference between active and passive ONA.David Green describes Organisational Network Analysis (ONA) as a means of applying a fresh lens on relationships and behaviours both within and between teams, and how work really gets done in a business. It enables social capital to become visible and offers people analytics teams a supplementary and powerful data set to really understand productivity and performance within their companies.As organisations continue to embrace the concept of agile, cross functional and flexible working, weâ€™re seeing the emergence of new teams and new networks being formed where the work is actually being done, which is information that is not captured in traditional organisational charts. They bear little resemblance to the actual web of people involved in executing and delivering on the work.The effectiveness of an organisational network analysis is dependent on data available that describes the relationship between colleagues or between teams. There are two ways that we can collect the necessary information required to conduct such an analysis. The first is with an ONA survey, which is also often called active ONA.
