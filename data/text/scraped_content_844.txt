Title: The "why" of feedback Content: The purpose of giving feedback is to improve the situation or the person's performance. You won't accomplish that by being harsh, critical or offensive.You'll likely get much more from people when your approach is positive and focused on improvement. That's not to say feedback always has to be good, but it should be fair and balanced.
Title: Timing of the feedback Content: The closer to the event you address the issue, the better.And it's much easier to provide feedback about a single, one-hour job that hasn't been done properly than it is to do so about a whole year of failed, one-hour jobs.But if the situation involved is highly emotional, wait until everyone has calmed down before you engage in feedback
Title: Make it regular Content: Informal, simple feedback should be given much more often than this â€“ perhaps every week or even every day, depending on the situation.It's not a once-a-year or a once-every-three-month event. Though this may be the timing of formal feedback.
Title: Keep in mind Content: Prepare your comments: Will help you stay in track;Be specific:Tell the person exactly what he needs to improve;Criticize in private:While public recognition is appreciated, public scrutiny is not;Use "I" Statements:Give feedback from your perspective;Limit your focus: no more than 2 issues/session;Talk about positives too. But don't overdo it, because it takes away the message;Provide specific suggestions:what needs to be done to improve the situation;Follow-up.
