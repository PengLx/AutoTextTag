Title: Constraints and productivity Content: If you make work a scarcer quantity, you’re more likely to use time wisely and get things done than if it feels like an endless to-do list.And you cand do this by restricting your hours or restricting your workload.
Title: Time vs workload Content: Restricting hours: set aside a certain chunk of time for work and don’t work outside of it. For example, the Pomodoro technique for working in short bursts of time.Restricting workload: instead of deciding on a set number of hours, you decide on a set number of tasks.
Title: Constraining time Content: The biggest advantage of constraining time is that it’s always unambiguous.If you decide to work for three hours and then stop, there’s no confusion there.Disadvantage: time constraints can encourage a sloppier attitude towards work. For example, you might decide to spend all day studying in the library—but without tasks to constrain your productivity, you end up checking your phone.
Title: When time constraints work best Content: It’s unclear the time and effort required to complete the task.The work itself is ambiguous and may require a lot of trial-and-error.The work is continuous and can’t be easily divided into discrete chunks.
Title: Constraining tasks Content: The advantage of constraining tasks is that it focuses directly on the object of productivity: whatever you’re trying to accomplish: you can't fool yourself into believing you’re working hard but you’re not actually accomplishing much.Disadvantage:tasks can often be ambiguous or hard to predict. If you fail to predict properly you might create to-do lists that are unachievable or those that are trivial.
Title: When task constraints work best Content: Tasks are discrete and fairly predictable.You might be tempted to fill up time without making real progressThe tasks are frequently repeated, and therefore easier to estimate.
