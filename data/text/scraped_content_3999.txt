Title: Learning Something New Content: When we are learning a new skill, practicing is key, but what's more important is the way we practice and the variation we bring in the practice.
Title: Practicing with Variation Content: Making the conditions slightly different while practicing improves our skills faster.The modification between two practice moves needs to be subtle, not drastic.
Title: How to Learn a New Skill Content: Try practicing differently, making small but smart changes, spacing the practice sessions.A waiting period internalizes your practice.It makes you evaluate the results, focusing on what works and discarding what does not work.Constant modification and refinement, along with a 'cooling-off' period sets the skill properly.
