Title: The script of a lifetime Content: There seems to be, for most of us, a certain journey, that we follow throughout our life: the call of adventure is the first part, followed by the ordeal and ending with the victory. However, after the so-called victory-which, of course, implies the individual being successful - there does seem to be a blank. And this occurs because people react differently to the idea of retirement: some are scared of it, some enjoy it.
Title: Understanding our own journey Content: The journey of life is meant to be well understood in order to be enjoyed and well lived. Therefore, having a reasonable reaction to whatever happens to us, especially when it comes to the final stage - the retirement - is of particular importance, as it provides essential information on ourselves.
Title: A happy retirement Content: When it comes to the closure of everything that you have lived, you certainly want to have a positive experience. In order to make this happen, make sure you have done your best to achieve your goals while working hard. At the end of it all, enjoy the time you have left by being there for the ones who need you the most.
