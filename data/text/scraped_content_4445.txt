Title: Get Your Life In Order (GYLIO) Content: Many of us battle with the never-ending nature of our to-do lists. We feel overwhelmed because life admin is endless and invisible.We can tackle this issue through GYLIO practices. In essence, GYLIO is about bundling tasks into a single morning, day or week to enable you to clear your mind.
Title: Get back on track Content: GYLIO is a way for students to approach their problems with juggling so many opportunities colleges offer, from sport and culture to volunteering and leadership.A week to 'take a breath' and get things done is essential. The list will look different for everyone. When parts of your life that you are usually on top of begin to fall apart, it is time to take a day or week out and attend to the little things.
Title: Divided focus Content: Having multiple tasks on your mind splits your attention and that can reduce overall performance. This is known as "attention residue."While we can't eliminate distractions from our lives, we can create a "ready to resume list" and plan a return to the task.
Title: Schedule a GYLIO session Content: Ask how and when you're going to attend to the task. Whether you call it 'power hour' or GYLIO, bundle small, unrelated chores together to make the invisible, visible.
Title: Donâ€™t crowd the list Content: Overcrowding your list can make it feel too daunting.GYLIO can give the impression that you can take care of all your life admin in a day. It can also encourage people to put off burdensome tasks.
