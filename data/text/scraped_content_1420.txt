Title: The Two-Minute Rule Content: It helps you decide when to tackle a task by following the steps below:Define clearly what is the task and the actions that compose it.If the action takes less than two minutes, do it, although it is not an urgent or high-priority task; if not, defer it or delegate it.If you do not achieve the result of the task with the action, identify the next action and process it following the same criteria of the previous step.If doing a task will take less time than processing it, organizing it in your lists and tracking it timely,it is more efficient to do it right away.
