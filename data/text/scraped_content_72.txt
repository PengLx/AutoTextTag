Title: Curiosity as a life value Content: It means getting to the bottom of everything that you do.Not because you must. But because it’s fun to know things. Some things can’t be understood. But you can still admire them.
Title: Responsibility as a life value Content: It means owning your actions, mistakes, and current life situation. Understand what’s in your control, and fully own it. If you don't like something, you have the power to change it. What others do is not your concern, nor your responsibility.
