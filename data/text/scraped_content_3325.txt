Title: Practice makes perfect Content: Whether you’re learning to play the saxophone or studying a foreign language, practice, or repetition, makes perfect. Repetition increases the myelin, or fatty coating, around the axioms that connect our brain’s neurons. The more myelin, the faster our neurons work, and the better we learn something.
Title: Spaced repetition Content: Spacing out the repetition, rather than cramming it into one session, is more effective. To use this learning technique:Start by establishing a manageable study schedule.Choose a method for storing and organizing information.Don’t forget to test yourself periodically. Tracking your progress will boost your motivation to continue.
Title: Take time for reflection Content: In addition to solidifying what we’ve already learned, reflection also helps spark new ideas. And it usually happens when you're not working.Our most creative ideas don't come when we're consciously focused on the problem. but when we're interacting with people, gaining experiences and letting our minds make connections.
Title: Teach it to a child Content: The bestway to learn something is to explain it to someone else, preferably to a child.Or at least map out how you would explain something to a child.This is known asRichard Feynman’s learning formula.
Title: Learning transfer Content: Taking what we study in one context and applying it to another helps deepen our understanding of both.First, deconstruct the knowledge into its fundamental principles. Then, reconstruct it in a new field.For example, if you study Italian but alsowant to become a better cook, you can simply take a cooking class, or you take a cooking class in Italian.
