Title: Meanings of “protein”  Content: Protein is a macronutrient, a family of molecules made of amino acids. It is found in many different food items like meat and legumes. Even grains and leafy vegetables have some.Plant-based or animal-based proteins have varying amounts of protein and are not an even swap.Protein is also colloquially referred to like food that used to be known as the "meat group" like fish or beef.
Title: Protein-rich foods from animals Content: They may have more saturated fatty acids (beef and dairy especially)They may have more omega-3 fatty acids (fish especially)They don’t contain any fiber or carbohydrates.They tend to be very high in protein.If you need a lot of protein in your diet, meat is a great way to satisfy that need.
Title: “Plant protein”  Content: Plant-based protein sources don't have as much protein. You can get enough protein through a plant-based diet, as long as it is well balanced.Plant-based protein sources:They often contain fiber (especially legumes and whole grains).If they contain fat, they are often rich in “good” fats (for example, the omega-3’s in nuts).They contain plenty of starch as well, so it’s impossible to follow a low-carb diet if that’s a priority for you.
Title: Your overall diet Content: If your diet consists of the same narrow food groups, it will not be a proper diet, regardless if you eat a plant or animal-based protein. If you eat a strict vegan diet, you will need to supplement Vitamin B12.Look at the entire meal you end up with, and how that affects everything else you eat.
