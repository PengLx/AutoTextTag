Title: Confidence comes after you start, not before Content: Confidence is helpful, but comes after starting. To the procrastinator, a task feels dangerous - it’s when he could be exposed as a fraud.So before starting, he looks for more assurance that things will go well. This leads to more planning, more thinking, more delaying.
Title: Start one step at a time Content: The longer and dustier your to-do list gets, the more it seems like a hopeless tangle. But it’s a mirage, created when you try to map out everything in your head without actually doing anything. The whole list looks different the moment you knock off one tough thing.
Title: Don’t just work on something. Finish it Content: If you just work on something you will feel a sense of progress without actually accomplishing anything.If you can’t answer the question “What are you trying to finish right now?” then you’re probably making the task bigger.
Title: Stalling feels safe, but it's the opposite Content: Procrastination involves thinking about doing, without much actual doing. Beginning anything seems dangerous, but the real danger is delay. The most predictable, most damaging, and most easily avoidable dangers come from stalling.
