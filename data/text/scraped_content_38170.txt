Title: Generic Strategies Of Companies Content: Companies have core strategies that look great, logical and idealistic on paper, but offer nothing new to the market. These companies turn into generic ‘me too’ competitors in a saturated field, offering the same product or service with minor tweaks.The common strategies followed are excellent customer service, targeting of wealthy individuals and operational effectiveness.
Title: Go Your Own Way: Doing The Opposite Content: A unique way to find out if the company is following innovative and out-of-the-box strategies instead of generic ones is to see if there are competitors doing the exact opposite of what the company is doing.This way we get to look at the other end of the spectrum and real innovation and choice.Example: If one mutual fund company focuses on selling managed funds, another one can focus on not selling managed funds.
