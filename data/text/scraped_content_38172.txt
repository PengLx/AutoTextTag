Title: Doing Nothing Productive, Intentionally Content: The Rietoff Principle puts a licence on the wastage of time when the fun is devoured intentionally and with no guilt.This intentional enjoyment lets us work with focus and is apparently a cure for procrastination, which is nothing but wanting to do something else.If a day of the week is a ‘Rietoff day’, then you can relish and enjoy the time in a wholesome way, as it becomes a to-do list activity that you are doing.
