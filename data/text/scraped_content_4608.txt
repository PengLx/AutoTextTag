Title: Simplicity is a sign Content: The process of simplification can be a sign of aging. Our youthful health depends on complexity. Bones get strength from detailed scaffolds and connective tissue. Even the heartbeat relies on elaborate networks and controls. As our bodies age, these structures lose complexity, making them less resilient and eventually leading to frailty and disease.
Title: The meaning of "complexity" Content: A complex process involves various components interacting across multiple scales in time and space. To lift a foot requires electrical, chemical, and mechanical parts to coordinate across molecular, cellular, organ, and systemic levels.
Title: Complexity loss Content: A large and growing body of research suggests that biological complexity breaks down with aging.Various tissues and organs and their communication pathways gradually diminish and lead to disease or disability.
Title: Slowing complexity loss Content: We may be able to slow, or even reverse, some of the complexity loss due to aging. Adding complexity to your daily routine can have far-reaching effects.Aerobic exercise and resistance training can increase heart rate complexity.Tai Chi, combined with physical movement, breathing techniques, and meditation, affects postural control.An extensive and diverse social network promotes better health and wellbeing.Learning new skills or solving mental puzzles can improve cognitive function.
