Title: Cover The Basics Before Launching Content: Think about things like: securing social media handles, having a distilled brand message and design, a newsletter subscription, trademarking your name/logo, getting an EIN so you can write and receive checks, and establishing an LLC or sole proprietorship.Before the final launch cycle, tie up any loose ends, and get ready for launch so post-launch everything can run on its own, and is very organized.
Title: Make a Schedule Content: The struggle to establish a side hustle includes converting previously nonwork time to dedicate to it.To lessen the impact, create a schedule considering your situation and tendencies, like your most productive time of the day and what activity would create less damage if sacrificed.
Title: Find a Support System Content: Having people that you can vent to or ask for guidance is key to making any venture a success. Even if you choose to fly solo, surround yourself with people you can talk to, bounce ideas off of, and get genuine feedback from.Scour your network for people in the same industry, reach out to mentors, and even ask close friends or co-workers for their honest opinions.
