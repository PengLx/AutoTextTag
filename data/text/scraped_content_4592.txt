Title: Different Psychologies Content: Psychology, which was largely developed in North American and Europe, has largely been able to understand human behavior and mental processes.As our knowledge of different cultures and thought patterns opens up, we find that this understanding isn't as universal as previously thought.
Title: The Right Representation Content: Normally, studies conducted to understand human behavior have participants representing the wider human population, which may be true in a certain geography but isn't accurate when we take into account other cultures and demographics.More than 90% of the participants in psychological studies originate from countries that are Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic (W.E.I.R.D) which is neither a random sample nor a real representation of the human population.
Title: Different Ways Of Being Content: People across the world have different ways of describing themselves, different mental associations and thinking styles, possessing radically diverse motivations, upbringing, and social relationships. What may be categorized as a mental illness in a certain part of the world may be normal behavior in another.Cultural differences pervade in a wider array of human behavior and there is a need to increase the circumference and scope of these studies.
