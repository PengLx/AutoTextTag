Title: Motivation Through Watching Sports Content: Sports are huge, and gather millions, if not billions of audience eager to watch its many forms, like football, tennis, basketball, or cricket.Many people would feel motivated to work out, become fitter, or play the particular sport in which they are glued to and make a positive difference in their lives, instead of just being a passive, popcorn and hotdog eating audience. But new research shows that this is often not the case.
Title: From Audience To Athletes Content: Many committees and sports organizations anticipate that the population would watch the sports and become more active physically and to an extent, it does motivate a small percentage of people to change their lifestyle for the better.The 1992 Barcelona Olympics showed that people taking part in sports increased to about 4 percent in the span of 6 years, but that has been an exception, where the methodology of the statistics is in question.
Title: The Opposite Effect Of Sports Content: Most people would not even want to go out on a sunny day when the game is on, instead gathering snacks to watch it on the LED screen.We cannot expect them to take up sports, just like we donâ€™t expect people to start singing after watching a concert, or take up acting lessons after watching a movie.
Title: The Demonstration Effect In Sports Content: New studies show that watching elite athletes could dampen the will to work out. Watching athletes demonstrate their prowess makes us realize that even if we trained full-time, we could never be like them.Sports role models impress people, but not enough to get them to move towards a better version of themselves. This can be improved if they get constant reinforcement towards their goals.
