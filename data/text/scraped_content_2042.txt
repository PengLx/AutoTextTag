Title: Think like a scientist Content: If we can distance ourselves from our feelings that support our biases and can learn to treat them simply like another data set, then we can look at our personal beliefs and compare and analyze them against other information objectively.This means that we can stay fact-focused and open minded, truly hearing and respecting what others say or do.

Time can also beahindrance to working more scientifically from an operational standpoint.Then good emotional intelligence is more dependable than pure rational thought and scientific process.
