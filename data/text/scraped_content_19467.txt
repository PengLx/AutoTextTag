Title: Connecting with an audience through a screen Content: Most of us have switched to working primarily online since March, and the initial excitement of virtual happy hours is long gone.When having a video conference, keep in mind that you are talking to a group of individuals who are sitting at home alone at their computers. They have every temptation and opportunity to multitask.
Title: Sharing stories Content: Connect with your audience from the start by sharing a relevant story and asking for their participation.Choose a story that is more personal than you would tell in a regular work setting. The barriers between work and life are coming down and you can use that to your advantage.
Title: Large vs smal online audience Content: If the group is small, ask a question from the start and turn your presentation into a conversation.If the audience is large, bring audience members together through polls, “raised hands” in response to yes-or-no questions, and the chatbox.
Title: Projecting energy through a screen Content: Your main tools to project energy through a screen are vocal variety, hand gestures, facial expressions, and posture.Raising and lowering your voice, changing your tone, speeding up and slowing down are great ways to keep an audience listening.
