Economics
Title: Unconscious Bias Content: We are often biased without even knowing it and our unconscious belief patterns result in many social inequalities.There is a lot to gain by simply being aware of our unconscious biases, and we need not be tied to obsolete convictions that have crept into our thinking and behaviour.
Title: The Skin Color You Donâ€™t Like Content: Pop culture and the media we have consumed since the last few decades(depending on our age) has resulted in certain skin tones, social classes and genders being equated with attractiveness, success or even worthiness. We have ended up wearing colored glasses made of our belief patterns and ideas that distort our view.One has to be truly present with people around them.
Title: The Wage Gap Can Be Closed Content: If dark-skinned people were given the same wages as their fairer counterparts, they would earn a trillion dollars more. Racial inequality is a collective bias that is throttling our progress.
Title: The System Is Already Gamed Content: Many healthcare professionals across the globe vary their treatment according to the color or ethnic origins of the patient. Breaking these structured biases that are entrenched deep into the system is hard, but if success is achieved, can result in fewer misdiagnoses and better patient care as a whole.
