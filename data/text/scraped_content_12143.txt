Title: Traditional Job Interviews Content: .. often have borderline illegal questions, which may be discriminatory and make the employee feel entrapped. Questions like ‘What are your weaknesses’ are blatantly trying to expose the candidate, and making the person act submissive towards the prospective employer.
