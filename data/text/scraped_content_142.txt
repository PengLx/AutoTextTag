Title: If you want to remain mediocre at something forever, keep it to yourself Content: If you want to become extremely successful, then openly share your dreamswith your loved ones. Friends and family will also hold you accountable to your dreams and goals if they see you not making progress.
Title:  Content: “It doesn’t matter what your vision is. It matters what your vision does.” — Peter M. Senge, The Fifth Disciple
Title: Practice is all about perfecting skills Content: True practice and learning force you to deeply examine the chinks in your armor. You are only as strong as your weakest link. In a world that tells you to ignore your weaknesses, true practitioners do the opposite.
Title: Address problems as they arise Content: If you do not address a problem in 0.25 seconds after a mistake is made, then you probably won’t do anything about it. You’ll shrug your shoulders and keep going. This is really bad for learning.If you simply address your problems on the spot, correct them, and learn better ways, then you don’t have to continuously repeat the problem.
Title: Learning and growing are emotional and often painful experiences  Content: When you go through a painful experience, that experience can only become one of two things to you. It’s either going to become a long-term problem, or it’s going to become a core strength.
