Title: Continued Content: They are practically puppets, who are forever signed to the higher ups for the fame and popularity, and now we have a new wave of people idolizing them. The higher ups and these companies are taking advantage of society with this crap, and people are falling right into their hands like a fish to a hook of worms.Masturbating to this filth is their way of keeping the weak... weaker. It's their way to hold you down, to take your soul away, to take your masculinity, your power, your energy, your semen. It's their way to keep you powerless. You fall into the lust they throw at your face, and you eat it up like a pedestrian throwing pieces of bread to street pigeons.Are you seriously going to let these people slowly take your soul away? Take away what you once were? Are you going to pathetically fall right in their trap? Or are you going to get your lazy self up out of bed, stop looking at these dang pixels, put the dang lotion away, put the dang tissue away, and actually do something worthwhile for your life?! It's your choice, your decision, your life.Note : Please Share This To Your Loved One's Especially Younger One's Saved Them , Tell Them.
