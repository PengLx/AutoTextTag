Title: Performances In Isolation Content: The world is used to seeing people performing in the iconic public streets and podiums all across the planet, it is a strange sight now, with near-total emptiness and silence as ‘Quarantine’ becomes the rule.Performance artists, who usually rely on small and big crowds, are now springing up in their homes and balconies, and of course, online, live-streaming their performances to the entire world while being isolated from it.Even though most of the events, news, interaction and performances are now online, whatever is left of our confined lives has started to appear more real.
