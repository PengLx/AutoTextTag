Title: Our Image In A Professional Setting Content: In a professional setting, our identity is largely governed by the perception of our peers, colleagues and bosses,Our ‘image’ depends on how they measure the impact of our behaviour and actions, how our character is perceived and how we are compared with others. We cultivate our image as what others think about us matters more than we would like to think.
Title: Our Digital Image Content: People who want to hire us, invest in our companies or collaborate with us increasingly look at our digital footprints on LinkedIn, Facebook, Google and Twitter to ‘profile’ us.As we go more and more online, the way we are perceived digitally, in our display pictures, zoom videos, emails and social media provides a mountain of data for humans, and machines to make judgements about our personal and professional attributes. 
Title: Working With The Algorithm Content: As companies and individuals access our digital avatars and make their judgements, we have the ability to curate them and tell them a story that we want them to hear.We need to understand the algorithms that are formulated to identify signals and patterns, and ‘hack’ them to our advantage.
Title: The Way We Live Digitally Content: Your tone of voice can make others guess your truthfulness and even health. One can practice speaking in a way that is appealing and professional.The words we say or write can be easily analysed through AI software and create a full character profile of us. What we write will become our avatars language and personality.Our social media posts can be analyzed for quality, content and a whole spectrum of information can be dug about our beliefs, behaviour and preferences.
