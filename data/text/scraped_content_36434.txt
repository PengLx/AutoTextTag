Title: Antilibrary: the power of unread books Content: An antilibrary is a private collection of mostly unread books. It is not an ego-boosting appendage but a research tool. It should contain a collection of resources around themes you are curious about. It should include as many unread books as your financial means allows you to put there. The more knowledge you accumulate, the larger the rows of unread books.
Title: The antilibrary makes us aware of unknown unknowns Content: The vastness of the unknown can feel overwhelming, which is why people feel uncomfortable with accumulating books they haven't read. But embracing the unknown is what drives discovery.  The antilibrary is then a reminder of everything we don't know. Being surrounded by books we haven't read yet reminds us how limited our knowledge is - it is a humbling experience.
Title: How to maintain an antilibrary Content: Make notes of all relevant references. When an author mentions another book, make a note of the exact reference, then research it. In the process, you will discover books that genuinely piques your curiosity that can be added to your antilibrary.Ask fellow readers for recommendations. Allow for chance discoveries. Ensure you leave space for interesting books that you randomly bought because the title or cover grabbed your attention.Do not expect the proportion of unread books to decrease. The more you read, the more unread books will be added to your antilibrary.Improve your relationship with knowledge. Your antilibrary may feel a bit anxiety-inducing. Remember that knowledge is a process, not a possession. An antilibrary is an investment in yourself.
