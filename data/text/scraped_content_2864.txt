Title: Life is not linear Content: Life is a cycle of good times and bad. Itâ€™s not linear. There are always going to be ups an downs. But you can still make safe choices.Looking at the bright: downs help us to appreciate and understand what an up looks like.
Title: The negative bias Content: Our brains have a negative bias. Every bad comment or news about us, or around us make a bigger impact on our perception about ourselves and the world than we realize.Enjoying life starts with shifting our mindset, seeing things in a new way.
Title: Effects of the negative bias Content: This bias robs us of the joys around us because it causes us to:Worry more than necessary and fear the worst.Focus on bad narratives for too long.Play the victims, to get sympathy from others.Have unrealistic expectations for ourselves.
Title: Enjoying the little things Content: The habit of taking even mild pleasure in small things is life-changing:Make time to watch the sunriseUse your mornings to take care of yourselfLose track of time with your favourite bookListen to the sounds of natureBe present in the moment.
