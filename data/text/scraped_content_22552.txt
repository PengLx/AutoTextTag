Personal Development,Technology & The Future
Title: Inventions Come in Stages Content: Invention often comes in stages and phases, when existing technology is looked at and mixed with new creative insights, a process that sometimes takes thousands of years.This makes it hard to pinpoint the exact time and place a certain object is invented.
Title: The Wheel And The Axle Content: The wheel and the axle didn't suddenly spring up, but were a gradual, phased invention, starting with rollers that reduced friction on the ground, and helped the Egyptians and Mesopotamians move heavy objects.The oldest discovered axle was found inside a potter’s wheel in a miniature, toy-like form in Mesopotamia. The fact that the center of the wheel is stationary as compared to the circumference is in fact the greatest mechanical insight ever known.Combining the wheel with an axle was genius, leading to the invention of the wagon and other transport vehicles.
Title: The Invention of The Full‑Size Wheeled Vehicle Content: The name given to the first full-size wheel, according to paleolinguits, was ‘Kweklos’ which meant ‘to turn’.The time of this invention is said to be about 5400 years ago, though the exact location of the invention varies from Russia to Slovenia.The inventor was a genius in the conception and craft, as he was able to solve engineering, design and woodworking problems to scale up a toy into a full-size wagon.It had a profound effect on the productivity of farmers, and it even helped populations move towards other places that were not close to the river and were thus unexploited.
