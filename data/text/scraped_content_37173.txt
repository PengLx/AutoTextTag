Title: The process of learning Content: Deliberate iteration always leads to delegation. Consider the most natural geometric progression, starting with 1 and a common ratio of 2. An assumption is made here that since breathing is THE life-giving /grounding process and involves three steps of inhalation, retention, and exhalation; that the respective dimensional organisms follow the breathing pattern as such in a geometric progression.Now we mentioned that the observer’s role or 4-D is required to look at the chaos that is presented in front of you without judgment , (dissolving shadow/ego ) and thus I am making an assumption that to assume this observer’s role, one has to breathe with the ratio of 8s inhalation, 16s retention, and 32s exhalation while being present to learn any particular activity.
