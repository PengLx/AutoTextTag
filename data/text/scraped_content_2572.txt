Title: Persistence Content: Few people accomplish worthy goals the first time around. Persistence enables you to try again (and again) after you fail. It's useful in any profession that requires problem-solving.On days you feel like giving up, focus on the immediate moment, and how you can make even just the slightest bit of progress (or fix a setback) by the end of the day.
Title: Courage Content: Itis the ability to act in spite of fear. But courage doesn't need to be impulsive. After all, it's likely the fear exists for a reason and courage depends on whether or not you think the action is worth it.
Title: Patience Content: It helps cultivate this rational thinking.The next time you feel an angry impulse coming on, don't give in to it. Try to remember, expressing it won't make it feel better.
Title: Sociability Content: People may not remember what you did, but they will remember how you made them feel. Tact, timing, and etiquette are all in the realm of sociability.People like working with people they like. Sociability makes your job easier and could make everyone else's jobs more pleasant, which is an asset to any team.
