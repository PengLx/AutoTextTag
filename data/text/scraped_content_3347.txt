Title: Happiness vs Joy Content: Happiness is dependent on outside circumstances to align with your expectations so that the end result is your happiness. Itâ€™s based on internal and external circumstances, thus unstable, with its chronic lack leading to despair and depression.Meanwhile, joy is internal and not contingent on anything in order to exist. It can be cultivated and the first step to do it is to understand the difference between happiness and joy.
Title: Finding Joy Content: Happiness lies on transitory things,so simplify your life and possessions to get a clearer path to a better internal life. When stuff, people, and the problems they bring fall away, the resulting stillness allows you to find the self-sufficient joy that resides inside.Joy comes when you make peace with who you are, where you are and why you are. When you need nothing but your truth to bring peace, then you have settled into unshakable abiding joy.
