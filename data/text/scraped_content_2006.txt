Title: The goal of staying focused Content: The goal is not constant focus, but a short period of distraction-free time every day.Twenty minutes a day of deep focus could be transformative.
Title: Do creative work first Content: Typically, we do mindless work first and build-up to the toughest tasks. That drains your energy and lowers your focus. In order to focus effectively, reverse the order.Check off the tasks that require creativity or concentration first thing in the morning, and then move on to easier work.
Title: Allocate your time deliberately Content: We are truly focused for an average of only six hours per week.You want to be really diligent with what you put into those hours.90 percent of people do their best thinking outside the office. Notice where and when you focus best, then allocate your toughest tasks for those moments.
Title: Train your mind like a muscle Content: We've trained our brains to be unfocused.Practice concentration by turning off all distractions and committing your attention to a single task.Start small, maybe five minutes per day, and work up to larger chunks of time.
