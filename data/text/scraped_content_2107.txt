Title: Why we don't take time off Content: We think more work should equal more output: we see productivity not as doing more with less. But simply doing more.We’re afraid of being “left behind”: not only could we miss out on some important conversation, but we worry that we’ll be left behind.Work has become a larger part of our identity: we feel personally connected to the work we do. Taking time away opens up all sorts of questions that can be hard to face.
Title: Deliberate rest Content: It isa play on the term “deliberate practice” and it meansengaging with restful activities that are often vigorous and mentally engaging.It is not a continuation of work, but a way to findactivities that let you recharge from your workday, while still being mentally productive.
Title: During periods of deliberate rest Content: Be unreachable:the more available you are to requests, emails, and messages, the more likely you’ll be to give up on your resting time.Focus on the important, yet non-urgent tasks on your list: things like exploring new skills, finishing side projects, or sharing your work and engaging with your community.Connect with people you’ve been meaning to: a simpleconversation with someone who makes you feel good can give you a cognitive boost you can carry with you.
