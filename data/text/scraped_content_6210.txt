Title: Shelter and refuge Content: Our homes are now being used not only as shelter and refuge, but also as workplace and school and gym and theater and restaurant and bar and laundry and town square.But whether a house or a compact apartment, those dwellings were never meant to be as profoundly multifunctional as a shelter-in-place scenario requires them to be.
Title: Rethinking utility Content: A home of any kind is a blessing. But quarantine also means that small elements of home design can have significant consequences.How much space you have, the number of rooms, whether you have internet, a dishwasher and washing machine, whether you have an area in which to exercise or be alone or be together or cook or get fresh air—those factors will now take on even more weight.
Title: Home as the only place Content: Confinement can heighten existing tensions and threats. It can also create new ones.Even people who are usually good at handling stress can find their mental health affected by periods of continuous closeness.Constant togetherness can be a great thing, right up until it isn’t. So if you live with others and find yourself needing space of your own, tell them that.Use creative hacks: for example, ifa bedroom is doubling as an office, create the ritual, at the start of the workday, of shutting the door (a sign that the bedroom is now a workspace).
