Title: The Martyr Complex Content: Individuals who show signs of the Martyr Complex often act in a way that attracts misery. It is actually believed that they do this on purpose, in order to avoid personal responsibility or simply because they are drawn to 'masochism'.Moreover, psychologists have come to the conclusion that these persons tend to have or to have had an abusive or codependent relationship. 
Title: Recognizing the "Victim" Content: A Victim Complex sufferer is a person who has difficulties when dealing with trauma, in any shape that this can take.Among the most common traits, we can often find the refusal to accept responsibility when handling their issues, the difficulty to move on from a tragic situation or a tendency to be both pessimistic and critical when talking about others. 
Title: Suffering from the Victim Complex Content: Persons who suffer from the Victim Complex tend to manipulate their partners, in order to hide their own lack of responsibility and maturity.Therefore, it is very often that these relationships end up after having become extremely tenuous. 
Title: Saving yourself from the Victim Complex Content: When dealing with the Victim Complex, most of the individuals tend to search for the solution in their partner. However, when not properly handled, actions taken by people who believe themselves as 'saviors' can actually do more harm than good.Therefore, as expected, the real help can only come from mental health care professionals, as this complex can prove extremely dangerous when not dealt with appropriately.
