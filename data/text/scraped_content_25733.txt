Title: People walking barefoot Content: One study showed that running in cushioned sneakers encourages people to stamp on the ground harder than running barefoot.Another study found that although calluses thicken as people walk barefoot, there is no trade-off in sensation from the extra protection. The hard surface of the callus send mechanical force through the foot to the nerves inside the skin in the same way as an unprotected sole.
Title: Disadvantages of cushioned shoes Content: With cushioned shoes, the sole slows the rate at which the body impacts the ground, making it more comfortable. However, the force is the same. The energy that shoots up your leg is about three times more in a cushioned shoe than if you're barefoot. Soft soles of shoes might also impact balance. As people age, their feet become less sensitive. If your feet can't sense what is going on on the ground, you may become more vulnerable to falls.
Title: Shoes can be quite invasive Content: It's not that people shouldn't wear shoes, but that scientists don't yet understand the impact of footwear on the body over an extended period.We add comfort when we wear cushioned shoes, but we reduce functionality. When people opt for fashionable footwear, it does not promote healthy walking. In one study, participants had to wear minimal shoes for six months. Although they were uncomfortable at first, they preferred them later.
