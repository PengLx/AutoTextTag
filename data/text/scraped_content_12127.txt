Title: Sega and Nintendo Content: In an attempt to win the battle of Genesis vs. Super Nintendo, Sega produced a tagline "Genesis does what Nintendon't." Nintendo couldn't get rid of the stigma that Super Nintendo was for kids.The console wars between Sega and Nintendo lasted from the 1980s to the early 2000s. Nintendo won that war but has since lost its top spot by Sony and Microsoft.
