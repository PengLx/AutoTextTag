Personal Development,Career,Leadership & Management
Title: Defining your career Content: Your career is defined by your skills and how you’ve used them, not by any external measure of your progress.If you focus exclusively on improving your skills and your impact on your organization (or to the world at large), the promotions and raises tend to come as a byproduct.
Title: Treat your manager as a coach Content: A good manager’s job is to help you and the rest of your team get better results. So it would be logical that she should be invested in your career. When you do better, then by extension, she does better.Hence, your manager should be on your side, who wants you to succeed, and who is willing to spend a good deal of time and energy to help you do that.
Title: See yourself succeeding Content: There is research that shows if you can create a clear visualization of yourself achieving the outcome you want, you prime yourself to act in a way that is consistent with what you imagine.
Title: You own your career Content: ... and you have more of an ability to shape it than anybody else.No matter how many people are on the sidelines helping you, ignoring you, or working against you, your career and your life are our responsibility.Don’t blame your manager, your significant other, your friends, or your company if you don’t have the career that you want.
