Title: Nostalgia Content: It is the sentimentality of our past, usually for a particular time and place associated with positive emotions, etched in our memories. Historical texts state it was termed as homesickness during war times.It is now considered a natural, common emotion, a way to escape from the current 'space-time' and mentally travel to one's past when the world around us was different. It is usually prompted by a feeling of loneliness, disconnectedness or meaninglessness, triggered by thoughts about the past, by our senses of smell and touch or through music or weather.
Title: A Time Machine Content: The feeling of nostalgia is like traveling in a time machine.The activities that were once cherished are no longer done, and the world that is remembered no longer exists.Nostalgia can be a form of self-deception, giving a rosy tint to the past, creating a paradise out of the moments of our lived lives.Deep nostalgia fosters a sense of serene melancholy and spiritual longing.
Title: Suffering Content: The deepest form of suffering is a feeling of extreme dissatisfaction about the impermanence and the insubstantiality of everything around us.Buddhism mentions suffering as inevitable as long as there is desire, lust and a sense of coveting/craving in our lives.Once we grasp this fully, we stop craving and struggling in hope and fear.
