Title: Happiness and emotional diversity Content: While most of us believe that happiness is the key to a long and healthy life, meaning first and foremost a life without stress, recent studies have shown that actually, it is emotional diversity that enables us to live longer and healthier rather than happiness itself.This means that it is better to experience a wider range of positive emotions rather than just happiness alone.
Title: Emotional diversity experiments Content: In a recent study, focused on measuring the systematic inflammation, a large number of participants were asked to rate the extent to which they had experienced both positive and negative emotions throughout the day, for 30 days. As a result, the people who experienced a wider range of positive emotions were also the ones who had the lowest rates of inflammation.
Title: Emodiversity and its benefits Content: Experiencing both negative and positive emotions can lead to better mental and physical health.Furthermore, the chances to get depression or even bad habits seem to be smaller in this particular case when compared to individuals who experience only positive emotions.
Title: Emodiversity and health Content: While research has shown that there is a certain link between people experiencing a wide range of both negative and positive emotions and being healthy, there is still no real evidence about how this actually occurs.Therefore, until further notice, why not enjoy your happy moments while trying to feel less stressed about the bad ones, as an exercise to better understand and enjoy this journey called life?
