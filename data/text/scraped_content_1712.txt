Title: The backfire effect Content: Is a cognitive bias and it means that showing people evidence which proves that they are wrong is often ineffective, and can actually end up backfiring, by causing them to support their original stance more strongly than they previously did.
Title: Why the backfire effect appears Content: People experience as a result of the process that they go through when they encounter information that contradicts their preexisting beliefs.When people argue strongly enough against unwelcome information, they end up, in their mind, with more arguments that support their original stance.
Title: Reducing other people’s backfire effect Content: If you’re trying to explain to someone the issues with their stance, you can mitigate the backfire effect by presenting new information in a way that encourages the other person to consider and internalize that information, instead of rejecting it outright.
Title: Reducing your own backfire effect Content: Be aware of how you react when you encounter information that contradicts your beliefs.You should not ignore it outright or immediately try to explain why it’s wrong. Instead, you should first try and look at it with fresh eyes, and assess it based on its own merit, without comparing it to your preexisting theory on the topic.
