Title: Reappraising Conversations Content: Imagining a conversation as a game you are to score as many points as you can.6: Shared feeling/experience (that’s when acquaintances become friends)5: Confirmation of an emotion’s legitimacy4: Pursuit of the topic3: Acknowledgment2: Implicit recognition (but changing the topic)1: Perfunctory recognition (autopilot)0: Denial/contradiction
Title: Don’t Be Self-Centered Content: It’s key to connecting with people to suspend your ego; to put your own needs, wants and opinions aside. Anxiety does the opposite bringing your feelings and expectations to the forefront.Focus on the other person. Simply listen to what they have to say and ask them to tell you more.
Title: Reappraisal Content: Just because you feel it doesn’t make it real. Feelings come from beliefs. Change the beliefs and feelings will change.Research and anecdotal evidence show that the simple act of positively reimagining something can be enough to decrease anxiety.
Title: Stoic Premeditation Content: Thoughtfully observe your fear and imagine the worst that could happen.Realizing the consequences of what scares you are not too dire reminds you that you are not afraid of what other people will do but of the feelings it will cause in you. It’s a fear of something you will cause to yourself and that can be changed.
Title: Noting/labeling Content: Tell yourself what you are feeling. Research shows that by naming it, the feeling is no longer an overwhelming amygdala emotional reaction; with a label the prefrontal cortex takes the reins, reducing the amygdala reaction.
