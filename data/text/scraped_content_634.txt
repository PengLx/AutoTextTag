Title: The "optimal rate" we process information Content: ....is between 170 and 190 words per minute.For most learners and people processing new information, slow things down so they don't lose you; for everyday conversations and written content in which no new information is being introduced, speed things up.
Title: First impression Content: People can judge us in just a 10th of a second. And in 2 or more seconds, people's judgments of us tend to become more negative.To avoid this, it comes down to 2 things: work on your smile and establish eye contact.
Title: Be aware of your stance Content: The feet tell us where the mind wants to go:Someone who is authentically engaged and present in the situation involves their whole body in the conversation. They get closer, they face you, and they bring their bodies and feet toward you to demonstrate 'I'm fully here".
Title: Have a memorable handshake Content: Handshakes are serious business in our culture. Typically, it's the first time we get to touch a stranger for a proper introduction. Yet, if you give someone a poor handshake, it's seared in that person's memory.
