Title: The all-or-nothing mentality Content: The all-or-nothing mentality is focused on convincing yourself that you need to quit your job so you can put all your energy into what you think you want.But you may not be financially prepared to quit your job. You may waste a lot of time considering if you should or shouldn't.
Title: An alternative to the all-or-nothing mindset Content: Ask yourself what in your current situation is really making you unhappy, and what have you not yet considered that could solve it. Once you have answers, consider them as possible solutions.Alternative solutions may not sound that attractive, but it is more realistic. All-or-nothing decisions are riskier, causing you to burn bridges or taking a leap without a safety net.
