Title: Trick your brain into calm Content: Become aware of your safety and breathing. Your fight or flight response may be in overdrive. Take note of five things you can see, four things you can hear, three things you can touch, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.Quiet your fears by visualizing a stream flowing past you. Each time a thought pops into your head, imagine the thought as a leaf on the stream.
Title: Use affirmations Content: Remind yourself how awesome you are with affirmations. Write down affirmations that remind you of your capabilities and strengths and keep them somewhere you can find them if nerves strike.Another suggestion is to keep a file of praise, awards, and other evidence of how good you are at your job an read them when you are struggling with a confidence crisis.
Title: Get clear about your feelings Content: Take a moment to really analyze what you’re feeling and strategize for that.Can you reframe negative feelings, like fear, into something more positive, like anticipation? If not, remind yourself that it’s perfectly normal to be nervous before a high-stakes situation.
Title: Phone a friend Content: If you’ve got a mentor or someone who’s just really good at helping you calm down and focus, reach out.
