Title: Peak performance Content: Performing at the top doesn't mean consistent peak performance.You should expect some variability in your performance. Your path is not going to be linear.
Title: Mimicry and comparisons Content: Self-improvement doesn't come from mimicry and comparing ourselves with others.Focus on getting better than you were yesterday and living up to your own potential and aspirations, not somebody else’s.
Title: Singular grand strategies Content: They don't work, because there is no one single way for anybody to improve.Singular grand strategies seldom work because they don’t account for exigencies that emerge along the way. Adaptability is also important in the path to self-growth.
Title: Setting goals Content: Goal setting sometimes inhibits self-improvement: the amount of thinking you put into something can decrease the amount of time you spend doing it.Once you begin to work toward your goals, focus on what brings you joy about the activity itself.
