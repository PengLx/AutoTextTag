Title: Household Chores: The Old Way Content: Logic dictates that whoever is good at a particular household chore is to do the same, for maximum efficiency. This is known as Division Of Labour in simple economics.If household chores are done by the one who is able to do them well, then one person ends up doing almost everything.
Title: Game Theory In Household Chores Content: A fair and equal division of labour using a method in game theory called ‘I Divide, You Choose’ creates a level playing field while making the person who is not adept at a certain task strive hard to level up the required skill sets.Example:  When dividing a piece of pastry between two kids, if one kid is told to divide the treat in half and the other is provided with an opportunity to choose which half is whose, then the first kid will ensure that the division is fair and equal.
Title: The "We're In This Together Now" Discussion Content: Instead of an ‘us vs them' attitude while dividing housework, a thorough discussion followed by a fair and equal distribution of work is the way forward.Good, honest communication about which chores are draining one partner and what can be tweaked to be less annoying for them is the key. Unpleasant chores can be done together as a team, with each partner dividing a load of work between the two, making it easier for both of them.
