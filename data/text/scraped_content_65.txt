Title: Our emotions are short-term biased Content: Our emotions are obsessed with the present moment because it’s difficult to look past our immediate fears and anxieties. And this prevents good decision-making.The sweet spot in decision-making is to find the short-term failures that enable huge long-term successes to happen in the first place.
Title: “Risky” behavior you should consider Content: Propose “moonshot” ideas, knowing that 90% of them will get shot down, but that if one of them gets accepted, it will be a huge boost to your career.Be excessively bold in your dating life, stating exactly who and what you want. Buy difficult books expecting that most of them won’t be useful to you, but also that, occasionally, one will completely change your life.  Say yes to every invitation knowing that most of the events/people will be boring, but that occasionally you’ll meet someone really interesting.
Title: Optimizing life for fewer regrets Content: Most of us are afraid of messing thing up. But we rarely ask, “Would I regret that failure?” If the answer is “no,” then that is absolutely a risk you should pursue. Sometimes, the right decision becomes crystal clear when put into these terms.
Title: Writing stuff down for clarity Content: The act of writing forces you to organize your brain.Vague feelings become structured and measured. And rereading what you write reveals your own logic (or lack thereof). It also reveals new perspectives you hadn’t considered.
