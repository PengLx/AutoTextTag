Title: Junk Knowledge Content: Most of the stuff we read is junk, with little or no value in a year.Expiring knowledge is something disposable, which we consume daily.Timeless or long-term knowledge is which retains or increases its value over time.
Title: Long-Term Vs Expiring Knowledge Content: Expiring Knowledge, is better than junk knowledge, as it is not as useless, but has a short shelf life. It catches our attention due to its topical and current nature.Long Term Knowledge is hard to find as it is not that visible and requires a keen eye. Long-Term Knowledge has no expiry date and actually compounds over time.
Title: Quality of Intake Content: Whether it's the questions startup companies ask in meetings, or the quarterly earnings of a company, short-term, expiring knowledge has very little context if not paired with long-term knowledge.If you intake more long-term knowledge by reading good books, you can be a better judge of which expiring knowledge to absorb and which to reject.
