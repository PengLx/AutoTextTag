Title: Opposite of Perfection is.. Content: “Now is the operative word. Everything you put in your way is just a method of putting off the hour when you could actually be doing your dream. You don’t need endless time and perfect conditions. Do it now. Do it today. Do it for twenty minutes and watch your heart start beating.”(Barbara Sher,I Could Do Anything If I Only Knew What It Was  )Perfectionism is busy and frantic. It is being everything for everyone. It is freaking out about not being good enough. It is comparing your beginning and someone else’s middle. Really, it is every type of comparison. It is trying instead of doing, and efforting instead of working.3  The opposite of perfection is being in the moment. It is what some people refer to as flow. Flow is when complete focus and ease take over, and time, ego, and concern cease to exist. (Check out this helpful overview on the Psychology of Flow.)Voltaire is attributed to saying, “Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.” Try something – try anything – to move through your perfectionism. Know that it can be a cycle that ebbs and flows, from start to finish and back to start again. If you are a recovering perfectionist, you might be on this train forever… that is ok.Drop your expectations and go.
