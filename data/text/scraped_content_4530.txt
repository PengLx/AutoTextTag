Title: Cravings and Indulgence Content: Craving is a natural reaction to things we desire, and we generally react in two ways when we crave something:Resisting the pull: We take the uncomfortable option to resist the urge and kill our craving.Indulge: We give in to the craving, which has several costs: Money, Regret, Shame, and Indigestion, to name a few.
Title: Responding To Craving Content: The usual reaction of resisting or relenting to cravings can be replaced by awareness about the cravingand approaching it withcuriosity. Observe the body's reaction and the mind's tingle towards the thing that is craved and see if it lasts long if just left to itself.This diverts the mind's attention by engaging it in a curious self-analysis and makes us aware of the craving, helping us make adjustments in our routine, as we get to know the cycle of these sensory events.
