Title: How to deal with a hothead Content: First off, you can't get angry too because then there are two angry people.Tell yourself they are having a bad day. Don't try to shut them up or talk over them. It doesn't work. Instead, listen actively. Don't judge or analyze what the person is saying at first. Just try to understand from their point of view.
Title: Active listening Content: Active listening has three components:Paraphrase: Repeat what they have said in your own words. "If I understand correctly... "Inquire: "You mentioned you found our proposed price unacceptable. Help me understand how you came to this conclusion?"Acknowledge: "It sounds as if you're quite disappointed with..."Active listening should be maintained throughout the conversation.
Title: Communication is more than just words Content: It also includes body language:55 percent of what you convey comes from your body language.38 percent comes from your tone of voice.Only 7 percent is from the words you choose.You don't want to argue over the phone or email as they are stripped of facial expressions and gestures and unwittingly simulating a blank emotional radar.
Title: Replying to an angry person Content: If you can't just listen and need to reply to a direct question, make sure you look at the problem from their perspective.Ignore the anger and hysterics, and instead give positive reinforcement only when they calm down.
