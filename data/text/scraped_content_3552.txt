Title: The Directly Responsible Individual Content: Steve Jobs insisted that all the items on a meeting agenda have a designated person responsible for that task and any follow-up work that happened.Public accountability works, because it ensures that a project or task actually gets done.
Title: When Momentum Disappears Content: Why the productive conversations in a meeting seemingly go nowhere:Participants are most likely immediately running to another meeting where their attention shifts to a new set of issues.Participants leave the meeting without clarity about what was agreed upon.
Title: To Do After Every Meeting Content: After and in between meetings, quickly send out clear and concise meeting notes and follow up on the commitments made.If you don’t capture the conversation and put it into a form that can be easily retrieved later, the thinking and the agreements can be lost.Persistence is a key influence skill. If you want anything to happen, you must follow up.
Title: Meeting Notes Are Useful Content: They help inform people who weren’t there about what happened and remind those who were there about what agreements they made.Use them as a tool to keep everyone on the same page and focused on what you all need to get done before you meet next.
