Title: Release the critic Content: Not only is anxiety painful enough, but we often get hit with a second round of self-critical thoughts.If your judgments make you more anxious, see if you can interrupt your self-critic by dropping into your heart and saying, “May I learn to be kinder to myself.”
Title: Practice tuning into the senses Content: In moments of moderate to intense anxiety,the 3×3 practice can come in handy.Drop into 3 of your senses and name 3 things that you notice about them: thethings you’re seeing, smelling, tasting, feeling, or hearing. This can help interrupt the automatic catastrophic thinking that’s fuelling the anxiety.
Title: Channel your anxious energy Content: If your anxiety isn’t severe, you can actually channel that energy into something productive.For example, if you’re nervously waiting to hear some news, get active—go for a walk, clean, organize, or garden instead.
