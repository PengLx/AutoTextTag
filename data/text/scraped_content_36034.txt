Title: Less people, less bullshit Content: And with less bullshit from others comes less bullshit from within you. How is that? you might ask. Well, we all know that bullshit creates problems, mostly unnecessary ones, and the more problems you think you have, the more your mind creates new problems whether to 1) steer your focus into more complicated problems to help you ran away from the important ones, or- which is most likely – 2) give you that high when you solve them.
Title: Your mind already got the solutions Content: Guess what, your mind has already the solutions for the problems it creates. That flaccid piece of meat (not your penis you dirty asshole, it’s your brain we’re talking here) knows a thing or two that you don’t, and that will be the case for the rest of your life. Unless you get your shit together. (i.e. kick some ladders out, all of them)Burn some bridges, heck, burn ’em allLook for who’s worth it, let them go, if they came back, let them go again, just to be sure. If they came back a second time, that only means one thing, they tolerate your bullshit, and actually there is nothing you can do to make them hate you, in other words, they fucking love your dead ass. And that’s a good thing, that’s what you want, those few people who truly love you.
Title: The hard truth Content: Let me explain my unexplainable self. You let them go and no one came back. Contrasting to the previous part, that only means one thing: they didn’t tolerate your bullshit all this time/ or they had enough (just to be fair). Thus, they’re unworthy. Now tell me, who’s the shitface who surrounded himself by people that would run away at first glance, and not even notice it? I’ll tell you who, You. Now go punish yourself.
