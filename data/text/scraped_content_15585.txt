Title: Identify your triggers Content: When you identify what's causing you stress, it becomes much easier to manage it:At times it’s not that difficult to spot the root of your mental health issues: an external annoyance (like the current global pandemic, for example) can disrupt your routine; this can spark anxiety, because it can make you feel like life is out of your control. Other times, you have to dig a little deeper: maybe there are distinct aspects of your job that you dislike, or maybe the number of meetings you’re required to participate in is draining your mental energy.
Title: Assess what you can change Content: When you recognize your external triggers, you can figure out what changes you can make to manage them.If having too many Zoom meetings is draining your energy, see if you can make your meetings shorter, or assess when and where you presence is not critically needed. If you’re stretched too thin and have the power to do so, you can think about delegating, or ask your boss what you should prioritize and what you can complete later.
Title: Asking for professional help Content: Sometimes eliminating external stressors just isn't enough. When you find yourself in a prolonged state of stress, it’s time to get the help of a professional. Chronic stress can have a negative impact on your quality of life and can also make physical health issues worse.
