Title: Peace, despite the noise in your mind Content: Understand it is impossible to silence your mind: Itâ€™s human to have thoughts.The more you fight your thoughts, the more you amplify them. Being non-judgmental is the key to stillness.Whenever you analyze, you are always thinking into the past and future, not in the present moment.Focus on what you are doing:  This restrains your mind from wandering.Return to focus whenever you wander away from it.
Title: Increase focus and stay present: Content: Mentally remind yourself of your present action: Use self-talk to direct your focus back to the present moment.Focus on your senses: Direct your attention back into your body and out of your head.Do things differently: Make things more challenging. As a result, you are forced to act consciously instead of acting on autopilot.
