Title: Minimize distractions Content: Don't leaveyour phone and computerwithin arm’s reach during practice sessions.Put them where you can’t see or hear any notifications so you won’t be tempted to stop practicing to reply to a message “real quick” and end up going down a distraction rabbit hole.
Title: Focus on quality Content: Start slow if you’re new to what you’re practicing so you can make sure you’re doing quality work, like landing one dance move well before moving onto the rest of the routine.Once you feel comfortable, increase your speed, but don’t lose sight of the quality of your practice.
Title: Divide your practice into sessions Content: Give yourself breaks in between practice sessions.Even professional athletes and performers take time between sessions to recharge so they can maintain the right quality level during practice.
Title: Use your imagination Content: Run through your dance moves, speech, or piece of music in your imagination when you’re not physically practicing.This can actually help you improve since many skills have a heavy mental component.
