Title: Approach social media mindfully Content: If you look at Twitter first thing in the morning, think about whether it’s to get informed about breaking news you’ll have to deal with – or if it’s a mindless habit that serves as an escape from facing the day ahead.Each time you reach for your phone (or computer) to check social media, answer the hard question: Why am I doing this now? Decide whether that’s what you want your life to be about.
Title: Prune Content: Over time, you have likely accumulated many online friends and contacts, as well as people and organizations you follow. Some content is still interesting to you, but much of it might irrelevant.Unfollow, mute or hide contacts; the vast majority won’t notice. And your life will be better for it.
Title: Social media as substitute Content: Make sure interactions on social media don’t become a substitute for talking face to face.When used thoughtfully and deliberately, social media can be a useful addition to your social life, but only a flesh-and-blood person sitting across from you can fulfill the basic human need for connection and belonging.
