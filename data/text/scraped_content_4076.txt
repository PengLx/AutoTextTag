Title: Grit and success Content: Grit is the ability to continue despite setbacks. It is about facing difficulties and navigating obstacles. It's taking ownership.The problem is that we can push ourselves too far and allow toxicity to build.
Title: Enduring when we shouldn't Content: When we endure more than we have to, we can become blind to the fact that it does not have to be that difficult. We just keep going.There is pride in grit. But there is no pride in enduring for the sake of enduring.
Title: When to endure Content: Do not endure from a place of suffering. Toxicity is never yours to carry.Endure from a place of strength and power. Endure from a place of love, and desire, and attraction.
