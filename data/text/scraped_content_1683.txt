Title: Setting your own deadlines Content: Createartificial deadlines for yourself. Understand that you can save yourself a load of stress by acting as if something is due earlier than it actually is.Mentally, this creates a stress-free zone when there's a time crunch.
Title: Leveraging help Content: If you are worried others will view you as inept if you ask for help,you most likely will procrastinate, and even more pressure will build up, as the deadline rapidly approaches.You can reduce this by leaving your ego at the door and simply asking others for help.Another way to get help from others is to ask for an extension - it can make a world of difference in the way you feel. But don't abuse this.
