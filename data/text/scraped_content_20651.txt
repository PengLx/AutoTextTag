Title: College as an investment Content: College is often described as an investment in the future. You pay upfront so you can benefit for years afterwards. According to research, as of 2011 a college degree delivered an inflation-adjusted annual return of more than 15 percent, which is a good deal.However, past performance is no guarantee of future returns. Wage growth is stagnating for college graduates, with average starting salaries increasing by just 1.4 percent from 2015 to 2018.
Title: The benefits of  college depend on the particulars of each person Content: While the evidence on the economic and happiness benefits is mixed, attending college depends on the particulars of each person.A child's gifts, circumstances, and career ambitions all affect whether college is the right choice. But, the parents are often more excited that their child will get into college while the child does not want to be there in the first place. While college is the right choice for many, it is good to remember that there is not just one path to success.
