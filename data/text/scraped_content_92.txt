Title: Resilience and change Content: You can only build resilience by accepting that everything will one day fail. The more ready you are to pivot when it does, the sooner you’ll see big changes coming, the better you’ll react to them when they arrive, and the faster you’ll get back to business-as-usual once they hit.
