Title: The theory of the 3 selves Content: The actual self is what a person believes to be now, based on current attributes and abilities.The ideal self is comprised of the attributes and abilities a person would like to possess one day— goals, hopes, and aspirations.The ought self is who someone believes they should have been according to their obligations and responsibilities.
Title: Regretting what we don't do Content: People regret their inactions more than their actions in the long term.A mistake makes you feel a great deal of regret, but you get over it quicklybecause you most likely can fix it.You can’t fix what was never done in the first place. Inaction, the utter lack of trying, is what will truly haunt you.
