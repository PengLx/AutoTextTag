Title: How smell works Content: Odour molecules that move through the air up your nostrils will bind to special smell receptors on the surface of nerve cells. The nerve cells send a signal to the brain's olfactory bulb, that is behind the bridge of the nose.People have about 400 different smell receptor types. The odour molecules create a pattern of activation in the nerve cells that the brain translates as a smell.
Title: How we react to certain smells Content: Smells can alert us about danger - we're repulsed by the smell of sewage and rotting food.We don't all respond to odour molecules in the same way. Butyric acid contributes to the smell of both Parmesan cheese and vomit, so it may smell offputting or appealing, depending on the situation.
Title: When we lose our sense of smell Content: A complete loss of smell, known as anosmia, can occur after a cold, sinus infection or even a bump to the head.Anosmia affects the flavour of food. However, it isn't always permanent and may recover naturally or through exercises like 'smell training' to re-stimulate the olfactory system.
