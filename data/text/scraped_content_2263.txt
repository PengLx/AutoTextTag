Title: Consistency Over Heroic Efforts Content: Though inspiration can suddenly strike, turning it into a tangible finished product is a matter of sustained effort. It’s getting up every day and doing the work.The best people in their field are the best not because of a few massive efforts, but because of consistency over a long duration.
Title: Seek Mentorship Content: We all need to grow, learn, and take risks. Having a mentor or coach makes this massively easier.Additionally, a good mentor helps you avoid making the same mistakes they have
Title: Sleep Content: Sleep is not just about rest. It’s the period where the mind is shut off and reset.When we sacrifice sleep, we also sacrifice creativity, self-control, and attention span. When sleep is lacking, so is self-control.
Title: Put Yourself in Good Company Content: Seek out people who know things you don’t and try to learn from them.Surround yourself with positive, honest, smart, and diverse people who bring new perspectives and are not afraid to challenge you.
Title: Focus on What You Can Control Content: Worrying about the result is a distraction from what you really should be thinking about: how you can respond, and what happens next.Your work leaves your hands at some point and what happens next is almost always out of your control. People either like your work of art or they don’t.
