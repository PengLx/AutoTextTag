Title: The Magic Bullet Of Dieting Content: Humans are optimistic and want to get things without the effort that is required, like wanting to be healthier, thinner and fitter without the toiling. Many psychological and cognitive errors form this kind of thinking.The Planning Fallacy is when we are overly optimistic about completing a task or project, or have an illusion of being self-disciplined or completely organized in the near future.The False Hope Syndrome: Many individuals set unrealistic targets for themselves, and then feel bad when they fail to reach the same. A target set too high also results in disappointment.
Title: Real-Time Counters Content: For thousands of years we crave for foods high in fat and sugar, and the age-old message of eating less and exercising more has always been there, and has been followed to varying degrees.The new trend of self-tracking steps using smartphones and smartwatches has resulted in more people moving, as they have access to real time achievements, readily available on their wrists. A study showed that step-counters(or any activity counter) made the person do the task more, and the absence of the same demotivates them.
