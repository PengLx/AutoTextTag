Title: Doing Something Out Of Force Content: When we do something out of force, even though we donâ€™t want to do it, it creates stress, and feels uncomfortable and difficult.When we procrastinate, we feel guilty because something important is in front of us and we are distracting ourselves with an unproductive, time-wasting activity instead of completing the task.
Title: Doing The Hard Stuff Easily Content: Our mindset can help us to do challenging, difficult tasks. If we choose to participate in an experience, which we know is uncomfortable, difficult or taxing to us (like running, for example), it does not feel forced.If we love the activity, or the experience, the rush, the sweat, the wind, then it is not difficult for us. We are doing it on our own accord.
Title: Feeling In The Mood To Do Something Content: Most of us believe that we have to feel in the mood to do something: we should be excited and concentrated and the activity should be easy, fun, comfortable.That results in running from the things that feel hard, overwhelming, uncomfortable.
