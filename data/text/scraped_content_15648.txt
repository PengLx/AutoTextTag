Title: The Brain During Periods Of Worry Content: During periods of panic, anxiety or confusion, one of the best strategies is to slow down and focus on your breath. Yes this is not new, and many people know about this, and still are not able to implement.Our brains’ dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the thinking and planning department, is our short-term working memory, just like the RAM in our computers. If we occupy the RAM space of our brain with too much worry, the working memory can crash.
Title: Breathing Exercises Content: Mindfulness can get our thinking brain back to being usable and free, as it acts as a junk cleaner of our mind. As meditation can be challenging for many, one can use a simple breathing exercise to ‘reboot’ the RAM in our brains. This is known as the Five Finger Breathing.Five Finger Breathing makes the use of many of your senses, including eyesight and touch along with an awareness of the multiple locations in your body, like your hands, nose and lungs. This helps you get back to reality and insulates you from the ongoing worry.
Title: The Five Finger Breathing Content: Keep your index finger of one hand on your other hand’s little finger (the outside of the hand). Breathe in, tracing the little finger up to the tip, and breathe out tracing it down to the inside.On the next inhale, trace your ring finger on the same way, going to the tip and then going inside on the exhale.Do this for all fingers and then reverse the process from the thumb back again to your little finger.
