Title: Using 10% of our brains Content: The source of this figure isn't entirely clear.People's capacity to develop any skill is a combination of practice and talent. A person can get quite good at almost any skill if they practice hard at it.
Title: Left-brained or right-brained Content: People used to speak of being left or right-brain dominant (where the left brain is more logical and algorithmic, and the right brain more artistic and intuitive).However, both hemispheres of your brain are involved in all of the complex work you do. The most effective thinkers are the ones who learn to rely on both their intuitive judgments as well as their reasoning.

But, even a little anxiety in that situation can provide information too valuable to ignore.

However, people study best when they learn new material in different modes, not just the one they prefer.
