Title: Limiting coconut oil use Content: You don't have to absolutely avoid coconut oil, but rather limit the use of it or replace it.The American Heart Associationadvocates replacing coconut oil with "healthy fats" such as polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats, like those found in canola and olive oils, avocados and fatty fish.
Title: Coconut oil and cholesterol Content: In relation to cholesterol:Coconut oil increases LDL cholesterol, the "bad" cholesterol, which has been associated with increased risk of heart disease.Coconut oil also raises HDL, the "good" cholesterol, especially when replacing carbohydrates in the diet.
Title: Coconut oil is calorie-dense Content: It is more than 80% saturated fat. And just one tablespoon has 120 calories.About the same as a large apple or four cups of air-popped popcorn.This means that consuming large amounts without reducing other calorie sources can lead to weight gain.
