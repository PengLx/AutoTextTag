Title: The “useful interruption” Content: It's a psychological trick to avoid work paralysis, inspired by  Ernest Hemingway's discipline of writing and it means to stop a task when everything is going well.You will be more motivated to get back to a task that you've interrupted when it was going well. 
Title: Not finishing a task Content: Studies show that it can actually be beneficial.To get all the positive effects from this (and to get back at it) you should feel that you are close to completing that task and you also should feel challenged enough by it, to care about its completion.
Title: Gestaltism Content: It is a school of thought emerged in Austria and Germany in the early 20th century.It was built of the belief that humans make sense of the world through patterns; thus, the whole picture was more important to us than its individual parts.
Title: Gestaltism and taks management Content: We can apply the belief of gestaltism (when we have parts of something, we always want to create a whole) to task management.That means that we want to complete something if we have parts of it already figured out, especially if it's close to making sense or close to achieving some sort of goal.
Title: Task interruption and the need for closure Content: When an interruption happens and it stops us from completing a task, we tend to feel unsatisfied and in need of closure.This interruption can provide a motivational boost and determine us to finish what we started, but it's not always the case.
