Title: Adaptation and happiness Content: Adaptation is the enemy of happiness.We buy things to make us happy. And they do, but only for a while. New things are exciting to us at first, but then we adapt to them.
Title: Experiences vs. Objects Content: Objects fade and become part of the new normal. So you’ll get more happiness spending money on experiences like going to art exhibits, doing outdoor activities, learning a new skill, or traveling.Experiences really are part of ourselves. We are the sum total of our experiences.
Title: Shared experiences Content: They connect us more than shared consumption.Even if someone wasn’t with you when you had a particular experience, you’re much more likely to bond over both having hiked the Appalachian Trail or seeing the same show than you are over both owning Fitbits.
