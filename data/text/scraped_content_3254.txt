Title: Life’s ups and downs Content: They aren’t optional but your ability to be happy throughout is.Positive people know that life is not only about positive stuff. They are just mentally prepared to embrace challenges and confront difficulties.
Title: Wait before reacting Content: You’re not in a normal frame of mind when you’re angry. Your anger won’t make you want to resolve a problem; it’ll just make you want to lash out at somebody.When you've calmed down, ask yourself if the issue is something that really needs to be addressed or if you just overreacted. If after 24 hours, the thing that bothered is still on your mind, speak or act constructively to remedy the situation.
Title: Take responsibility Content: Don't walk around feeling sad, angry, and mistreated because you think that fate should treat you differently. It's a damaging way to think.You and you alone are responsible for your happiness. If the world hurls misfortune at you one day, find a way to divert it or turn it into something positive.
