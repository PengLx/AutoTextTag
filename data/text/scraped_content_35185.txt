Title: The Love Of A TV Tray Content: TV trays were a practical household ‘mini furniture’ back in the early days when television had all but six channels. It helped families eat in a secure manner, with dishes intact, posture upright, and less spillage. It also helped navigate the TV better due to the space for the remote control(s).The beautifully designed trays added glamour and fun to eating while watching TV, which was a treat in itself even though there were few things to watch.
