Title: The Self: Buddhism vs Science Content: Buddhist teachings state that nothing is constant, including the self. The notion of an ever-changing self, where the body and the brain are constantly in a state of flux, is now being supported by scientific research.According neuroscience papers, there is scientific evidence to show that our brain is always in self-processing mode, extending to a diverse range of fluctuating neural processes.
Title: Sleep Theories Content: Ancient Indian theories differ from the standard neuroscience view about deep sleep being a blackout state where nothing is left, not even consciousness.It is stated that a certain subtle awareness is present, even in dreamless sleep, though there is no time measurement tool for the brain to put that in memory. That is why the brain does not know the time when we wake up from deep sleep.
Title: Meditation And Sleep Content: A 2013 study showed that meditation has some positive effect on electro-physical brain patterns during sleep, enhancing our capacity to process information and also maintain a heightened level of awareness.
Title: The Existence of the Self Content: Science has the standard approach of being stubborn in its existing ‘theories’, however unproven, and disregarding ancient science, like the denial of the existence of the self, claiming that it is just an illusion created by the brain. Once again, ancient Buddhist and Indian science is way ahead and maintains that there is a self, something supported by many neuroscientists too.
