Title: Myth #5: You Should Never Work At Home Content: Some people working from home have a higher efficiency on time spent working and performance per minute. The employees surveyed also reported they were happier working at home.
Title: Myth #4: Pushing To Get Things Done Content: Willpower is a limited resource, one that we deplete through hard, focused work. We need to take regular breaks to restore our flagging willpower and keep our productivity in the long run.Take a break and do something different for a few minutes every half-hour or so to give your brain a break and replenish your mental resources.
Title: Myth #3: The Internet Is A Distraction Content: The Internet distracts but we use it for researching items and retaining information. If you build up your searching skills and ignore distractions, like social networks, it becomes just a tool.
Title: Myth #2: Early Birds Get The Worm Content: Creative insights may come during “non-optimal” times of the day. Society might be structured for early risers but you should stick to working during times when you’re at your most productive (as much as possible).
Title: Myth #1: Multitasking Makes You Efficient Content: While multitasking your brain needs to do goal shifting and rule activation (turning off rules for one task and turning on rules for another).Switching tasks always carries a cost in terms of time and mental energy. And although the cost in time is short we switch so often that it stacks up and can consume up to 40% of your time.
