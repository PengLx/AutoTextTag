Title: The legend of "marathon" Content: The term "marathon" came from the legend of Pheidippides, a Greek messenger. T'he legend states that he was sent from the battlefield of Marathon to Athens to announce that the Persians had been defeated in the Battle of Marathon. It is said that he ran the entire distance without stopping and burst into the assembly exclaiming, "we have wÎ¿n," before collapsing and dying.
Title: Break down your run Content: A marathon is 26.2 miles. But if we break it down, we're really just running 10 miles twice, then finishing it off with a simple 10km run.You can apply this concept to your goals. Break them down, so they don't seem so daunting. Tackle it each step at a time. And if you need to, take breaks in between. It's not the end of the world.
Title: Prepare for the worst Content: It's important for us to be realistic sometimes as well.The better prepared you are, the higher the probability that you will "finish" your life's marathons.
Title: Keep in mind Content: Picture the finish line:Sometimes when the going gets tough, you need to envision yourself at the finish line, for a boost in motivation.We're not all meant to finish:There are many people who will give up during the marathon. And that's ok.
