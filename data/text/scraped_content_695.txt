Title: Know your audience Content: Who they are, what they want, what motivates them. Only then can you tailor your messages appropriately.You also need to be prepared for the fact that your audience is changing and evolving. Don’t assume that the communication strategies that worked well two years ago will still have the same effect today.
Title: Importance of timing Content: You will get far better results from your communication efforts if you try to engage with other people at a time when they are ready to engage with you.Think carefully about communicating in the evening and the weekends – if you send out messages at these times, what are you saying to your staff? Where possible, save messages in your outbox and send them the next day or after 11 am on Monday.
Title: Pepper your messaging Content:  What you say is less important than what other people want to hear.To get people to respond to your communication in the way that you want, you need to pepper your messaging with statements that get them onside.A good way to start is by using the phrase ‘thank you’.
Title: Real communication is two-way Content: It is an exchange that requires feedback.For example, if you are asking someone to do something, you could add in the following comment: “If you’re having difficulties or challenges with the project that you want to raise, please let me know and I’ll do my best to help.”
Title: Don’t blame your audience Content: If your attempts at communication fail, blame yourself.You clearly haven’t conveyed the message in a way that your audience wants to hear, at a time that works for them. Reflect on what might have gone wrong, so that you can do better next time, and then move on.
