Title: Life is a competition Content: We are all in competition, even if we prefer to discount it. Our achievements are only evident relative to others. You swam further, dance better, or got more Facebook Likes.We should recognize that there is competition going on. People interview to win jobs.And the best is only available to those who are willing to compete and fight for it.
Title: You’re judged by your actions Content: We are judged by what we can do for others.For instance, saving children or removing a tumor. Socialreward is just a network effect. Reward comes down mostly to the number of people you impact.However, we judge ourselves differently. We judge ourselves by our thoughts.“I’m a good person”. “I’m better than this.”
Title: Fairness is self-interest Content: We think the judgements of our bosses and parents and politicians are unfair and silly because they don't agree with us. And we believe they should agree with us.However, most of them are just trying to do their best, under different circumstances to your own.
Title: Life isn’t fair Content: Life would not work if it were "fair" to everyone.Companies would only fail if everyone who worked for them were evil. Relationships would only end when both partners died simultaneously.

Most of us are so blinded by how we think the world should work that we fail to see how it does work. You can only unlock your potential when you face reality.
