Title: Elon Musk's management rules Content: No large meetings unless they're of value to everyone.Don't have frequent meetings unless the matter is truly urgent.If you are not adding value to a meeting, walk out.Don't use acronyms and nonsense words for objects, software, or processes.Avoid any terms that require an explanation - they inhibit communication.Communicate directly with individuals rather than through a chain of command.Don't follow any "company rule" that doesn't make common sense.Ideas that increase productivity or happiness are always welcome.Never do anything that would make a great Dilbert cartoon.
