Title: Research On Our Partner Preferences Content: Our own partner preferences may not be fully understood by us.An organic study on peoples dating and partner choice indicated that one’s preferences, ideals and priorities towards their partners are a poor predictor of their eventual long-term partner.Another study that used surveys and statistical modelling to find connections in the personalities, romantic attractions and the quality of relationship found out that the preferences of the partners correlated with their own, as most people looked for similarities. The data set that computed the final long term choice found that partners with similar traits and personality dimensions do not ‘flock’ together for long.
Title: Real Life Vs Dream Life Content: People may not be communicating well about what they want in their partners or may have a lack of awareness, or even a myopic view of their life. Experiencing it for themselves is a better bet to find out what works.The dreamy idols that make up our early stages of attractions, especially at a young age, do not translate into someone one can spend the entire life with, where mundane activities like picking up groceries and taking care of the kids take precedence over being handsome or inspiring.
