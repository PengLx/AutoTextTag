Title: Do Your Research Content: In deciding where you want to work, consider the kind of experience you’d like to have:Is there a region of the world you've always wanted to explore?What kind of day-to-day lifestyle are you looking for?Is there a particular climate you prefer?How comfortable are you navigating life in a new language?
Title: Visiting  vs. Living in a new place Content: Try visit the place you're interested in moving to if it's feasible. Because working in a country or city is not the same as vacationing there.While hitting the tourist hot spots is great, try to explore neighborhoods where the locals live, visit grocery stores, and sit in restaurants. Then you can do one better and speak to other expats who live there to get a sense of what day-to-day life is like.
Title: Move for the Company, Not Just the Place Content: As tempting as it is to move to a beautiful place for the location and lifestyle, don’t do it at the cost of your career. There’s nothing worse than moving to a country for a job you end up hating, especially if your legal status depends on an employer-sponsored visa.Be proactive about researching the reputation of any company you’re considering.
Title: Prepare for Growing Pains Content: As exciting as it is to move and work abroad, such monumental change can also bring on waves of anxiety.Routines and cultural norms you take for granted don’t exist in other countries. Instead of fighting against them, recognize the benefit of a different way of doing things—learn new customs and challenge yourself to adapt to different business practices.
Title: Build a Community Content: Don’t be afraid to make the first move.Beyond work colleagues, tap into Facebook groups and Meetups, which will enable you to meet fellow expats embracing life in a new culture.
