Title: Biophilic design Content: Biophilic design is a concept of using both direct and indirect exposure to nature to increase wellbeing.Leading up to 2020, biophilic design was a major office trend. Amazon introduced spherical conservatories to its Seattle headquarters, and Facebook created a 3.6-acre rooftop garden at its Silicon Valley hub. Due to the pandemic, remote workers can bring the concept back home with them and create a work environment with their own wellbeing in mind.
Title: Playing with light and colour Content: Phillophilic design is about bringing nature in all its forms, including patterns, materials, shapes, spaces, smells, sights, and sounds, into the urban design on varying scales.Adding greenery is the most obvious starting point. Other additions are light and colour. Natural light supports the circadian rhythms of the body, which regulate our sleep-wake cycle and hormones. Earth tones can also have an array of positive psychological and physiological effects. However, colours should represent a healthy nature such as forest greens, sky blues, or savannah browns. Look outside and see how you can bring those colours inside.
Title: Nature creates a multisensory experience Content: Objects that move in a constant and unpredictable motion improve blood pressure and heart rate and positively affect the sympathetic nervous system. This can be incorporated into the home office by adding waving grass outside a window or a fishbowl on a desk. Other relics to add are seashells, geometric forms, or stones.
Title: A controlled and calm space Content: When things start to feel cluttered, you may have gone overboard. Taking walks in nature may add to the multisensory benefits, but most spend more than 90% of their time indoors, which creates an urgency to bring nature inside.
