Title: Moral Luck Content: We judge ourselves and others morally for things that didn't come out as intended, were unforeseen, or were influenced by factors beyond one's control.The judgment we should receive is based on how our actions turned out, rather than our intentions, no matter how good they were. This is called 'Moral Luck'.
Title: Feeling Morally Responsible Content: Some people do their parenting in difficult circumstances, and nothing that is done by them as parents is fully under their control.The good and bad traits that parents possess can find their way in the child, with them having no say as to what the child will eventually become or do.
Title: The Inner Paradox Content: Due to so many factors at play, parents are relying on good luck, pulling off a gamble on the child that is being raised. They don't have much leverage on the outcome, the net result of the actions of their offspring.There is an inner paradox, a duality that exists in the minds of parents, which can make them accept and also reject the responsibility they have towards their kids' actions.
