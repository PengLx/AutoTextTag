Title: Disease Event Classification Content: Epidemiology is the branch of medicine that handles the following:Incidence: the occurrence of a disease over a specified period.Prevalence: how many people are affected within a population.Control of diseases: an appropriate public health response.Two measurable factors mostly define the level of disease occurrence:The pattern and speed by which a disease moves.The size of the susceptible population.
Title: The terms an epidemiologist use Content: Sporadic refers to a disease that occurs infrequently or irregularly.Cluster refers to a disease that occurs in larger numbers even though the actual number or cause may be uncertain. Endemic refers to the constant presence and/or general prevalence of a disease in a geographic population.Hyperendemic refers to persistent, high levels of disease well above what is seen in other populations. Epidemic refers to a sudden increase in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected.Outbreak is the same as an epidemic but is often used to describe a more limited geographic event.Pandemic refers to an epidemic that has spread over several countries or continents, usually affecting a large number of people.
Title: Phases of a Pandemic Content: The one staging model used to direct the public health response involves the flu. The same basic model can be applied with variations to epidemics like tuberculosis or malaria.Phases 1 through 3 help public health officials know it is time to develop tools and action plans to respond to an impending threat.Phase 4 through 6 happen when action plans are implemented in coordination with the WHO.
