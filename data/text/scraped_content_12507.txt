Title: We Are On Our Own Content: In his self-help book "Smarter, Faster, Better", Charles Duhigg observes that we are now masters of our own time. The onus to manage our time, attention, focus and priorities is on us. We are our own motivation, and have a variety of 'productivity' tools to fine-tune our managing, teamwork, decision-making and absorbion of information and data.
Title: Divided Attention Content: There are an endless number of distractions, attention sapping ‘urgent’ tasks and other requests for action (like an email) that sap our limited energy and willpower, filling our days with stress and unnecessary procedural work.
Title: Old Management Fads Content: ... like the SMART(Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Realistic, Time-bound) goals, which are taught in every management class, are themselves part of the problem, distracting us from any actual productivity towards the realization of the said goal.Another example is ‘Stretch Goals’ which are so audacious that they start to demotivate and decrease confidence.
