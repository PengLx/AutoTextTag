The whole idea of continuous improvement is based on always looking for ways to do things better. Continuously.
Title: Stopping with the first workable solution Content: Another subtle form of groupthinking:When there’s a problem to solve and you call a meeting for example, the group wrestles with the problem and comes up with a workable solution. At that point most groups declare victory and adjourn.That’s a mistake and an opportunity missed.
