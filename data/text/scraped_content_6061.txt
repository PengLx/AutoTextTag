Title: Turning to apocalyptic entertainment Content: We may be finding that our taste in books and movies is taking an apocalyptic direction these days. We may even identify with the stories and the characters.This sounds a bit like torture because we use fiction to imaginatively aggravate our wounds, instead of to soothe them. 
Title: A form of self-flagellation Content: We usually seek to experiment the good,  but we also want access to the bad.While we are quarantined, we want to be distracted and cheered up. But we also want to be fully present in what is happening to us. And so we use fiction projections of the bad to reflect the evils of our outside world. Because this is a form of pain we are willing to accept.
