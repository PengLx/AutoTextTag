Title: An episodic memory Content: If you fall off a bike, you'll probably have a cinematic memory of the experience: the wind in your hair, the pebbles on the road, then the pain.Researchers have identified cells in the human brain that makes this episodic memory possible. The cells are called time cells that place a sort of time stamp on memories as they are being formed. This allows us to recall sequences of events or experiences in the right order.
Title: Re-creating events in the mind Content: The time cells are situated in the hippocampus and another area of the brain involved in navigation, memory and time perception.The time cells are marking out discrete segments of time within an approximately 30-second window, explaining why people who have damage to the hippocampus may experience a scrambled sequence of events.
