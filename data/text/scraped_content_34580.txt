Title: Learning as a tree Content: ..learning resembles a tree: you see the trunk, you see the branches, and you see the leaves... In the beginning any new field is intimidating. Through perseverence, one will start seeing what resembles a branch or a trunk, and then a leaf or two, and then the whole tree. When one sees the tree it could probably answer:“What is the essence of the idea that this single topic is trying to get at?” If you can argue a counterbelief to that idea, you really know you understand that area.
Title: Operator focused company board Content: You can have a corporate governance-type of board, which basically checks all the marks or you can try to have a more inclusive board with highly relevant expertise.Choose a board which is filled with operators, like Spotify does. There almost every member of the board has operated at a very high level role before. An operating board can be quite hands on and involved.
