Title: Solitude and Creativity Content: The difficult emotions we feel when we're alone actually transform us into intense observers, aware of subtle details that normally go unnoticed.Most of the time, this is uncomfortable (because we are social creatures), but it can also lead to creative breakthroughs if we accept it.
Title: Touch - a powerful form of communication Content: Digital tools are a weak substitute for a physical community. And screens don’t allow for touch, which is a powerful form of communication.Physical contact, from friends, loved ones, even acquaintances and strangers, has the ability to lower cortisol levels and ease anxiety.
Title: Work towards something larger Content: A great way to fight loneliness is to work toward a larger goal, one that is centered around teamwork and collaboration.Focusing on a shared vision helps disrupt the lonely brain’s destructive loops, allowing us to let our guard down and reintegrate ourselves into the social fold.
