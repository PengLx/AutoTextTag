Title: Draw a Picture as a Team Content: However bad it looks, draw a picture of your challenge and possible ways to solve it. Drawing engages your right brain and can release the hold your logical left brain has on thinking about the issue or "the box" the same way.
Title: Widen Your Perspective Content: Breakthrough thinking and creativity often come from making unusual connections.Oscillate between seemingly unrelated topics, concepts, or issues to find the connection that makes an idea to move "outside the box. " Don't discount anything as unrelated or unconnected.
Title: Question The Status Quo Regularly Content: Challenge conventional wisdom and make nonconformity the expected conversation. Ask "Why? " "How might we. .. ?" and "What if. .. ?" to come up with new ideas.Ask your team to imagine they are the competitors and to plan an attack on your vulnerable spots. This challenges the strategic status quo and identifies new issues from a different perspective.
