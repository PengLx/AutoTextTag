Title: Zoom gloom Content: A typical video call demands more intense focus on the words, as most other body language cues are missing.

For some people, the prolonged split in attention can overwhelm the brain by unfamiliar excess stimuli while being hyper-focused on searching for non-verbal cues that it can’t find.  A traditional phone call may be less taxing on the brain because it delivers on a promise to convey only a voice.ㅇ['Teamwork', 'Communication', 'Personal Development', 'Love & Relationships', 'Psychology']

To prevent yourself from making progress, you don't write your tasks down anywhere. Then you can remember a particular task while busy with another, briefly panic, and doing it all over a few minutes later.You don't make a list or schedule a time for any task. This could make the list of tasks feel manageable, and might also lead you to start one task at a time.

Title: Not taking real breaks Content: To help you get nothing done while feeling exhausted, don't take breaks during unplanned work. Keep struggling.Do tasks that don't directly accomplish anything.

Title: Dreams and Aphantasia Content: Strangely enough, people with aphantasia can dream normally, being able to see the visuals. It is the intentional ‘imagining’ that is affected and not the dream state.

Title: Models for society Content: Using mental models will help in understanding the dynamics of the large-scale social response.We are currently seeing first-order negatives (closing businesses), and 2nd- and 3rd-order positives (reduced transmission, less stress on the healthcare system.)We need to encourage the thinking, analysis, and decision-making that considers the effects of the effects of the decisions made. Then we need to use a feedback loop. This will give us a better chance of making good decisions.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Leadership & Management', 'Science & Nature']
Title: Ecosystems Content: One quality of an ecosystem is its resilience - the speed at which an ecosystem recovers after a disturbance.One factor that interferes with our collective resilience is the thin buffer of our economy. The closing of shops and business has exposed the fragile supply chains. Individuals and businesses don't have enough money saved up.The other is the social ecosystem. We don't have enough medical facilities and supplies. We optimized for a narrow range of possibilities and compromised the resilience of the system.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Leadership & Management', 'Science & Nature']

Title: Make bad behaviors difficult Content: If you watch too much television, unplug it after each use. Only plug it back in if you can say out loud the name of the show you want to watch. (Which prevents you from turning on Netflix and “just finding something” to watch.) This setup creates just enough friction to prevent mindless viewing.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Habits', 'Time Management', 'Productivity']
Title: Branches of psychology Content: The main difference between the cross-cultural psychology and the other branches of psychology refers to the fact that cross-cultural psychology analyses the effects of culture on human behavior, whereas the other types of psychology focus more on how people themselves influence the human behavior.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Problem Solving', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture']
Title: Happiness and emotional diversity Content: While most of us believe that happiness is the key to a long and healthy life, meaning first and foremost a life without stress, recent studies have shown that actually, it is emotional diversity that enables us to live longer and healthier rather than happiness itself.This means that it is better to experience a wider range of positive emotions rather than just happiness alone.ㅇ['Mental Health', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology']

Title: Why The 2-Minute Rule Works Content: The point is not to do one thing, but to master the habit of showing up. A habit must be established before it can be improved. Mastering the art of showing up, the first 2 minutes become a ritual at the beginning of a larger routine. This is the ideal way to master a difficult skill.

Title: The effects of physical activity Content: Scientific studies reveal that a few people will lose a great deal of body fat when they start exercising. Others will gain, and most will drop a few pounds.Studies show that most types of exercise increase appetite in most people, tempting us to replace calories and preventing potential fat loss.Other evidence suggests that physical fitness may affect people's everyday responses to food. Some past studies show active people of normal weight displayed less interest in high-fat, calorie-dense foods. They may still enjoy the same food, but will not actively seek it out.ㅇ['Health', 'Exercise & Fitnesss', 'Personal Development', 'Food']
Title: The old Victorian picture style Content: If you have a look at Victorian pictures dating from the 19th century, you will soon enough realize that back then people did not really smile. The reason for this involves two elements: firstly, the method to take pictures implied keeping the same happy face for hours to come, making it difficult for individuals to actually do it.secondly, as dental hygiene was not well developed, many preferred hiding their teeth and, therefore, posing with serious faces.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'History', 'Entertainment', 'Psychology']

"Title: Beliefs And Values Content: You have a set of beliefs behind each one of your values. If your beliefs around your values are too general, they can prevent you from changing your people-pleasing habits.For example, ""I am always there for people who need me"" is too general and could include every person. ""Always"" implies no exception to that rule. When you adjust those beliefs to ""I do my best to be there for my loved ones and friends,"" you have allowed space for exceptions."ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Mental Health', 'Love & Relationships']
Title: Maladaptation Content: The long-term effect of chronic stress is described as allostatic load.

Maintain dignity by giving choices where possible."ㅇ['Communication', 'Career', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: 14. Use Criticism Well Content: If you use criticism to bash or undermine, it will be harmful. If you dismiss criticism without reflection it will be useless.

Title: 4 Reasons Giving Constructive Criticism Goes Bad Content: You’re not offering anything constructive if all you do is point out problems. You can still direct attention to an issue, but make sure that you follow up with a helpful suggestion.You’re offering unrequested input. Before speaking up, ask yourself if this is something that really even requires your input or if your input is properly qualified for the situation.You’re starting all wrong if you open with “No offense, but…” “Don’t take this the wrong way, but…” “This might sound really mean, but…” These introductions function as an advanced warning for rude or overly personal words to come.You’re too aggressive on how you deliver your message.

Then forget everything else.Do-or-Die Mentality. Realize that every decision is temporary. Use an overall decision-making strategy that stretches over time, not that imagines each moment to be the most critical one for the business.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Money & Investments']
Title: 6 of the largest decision-making blunders Content: Sunk-cost fallacy. Present yourself with the new options at hand -- without considering the sunk cost.Narrow framing. When we're in situations that will repeat themselves over time, we should take a step back and play a game of averages.Emotionally driven decisions. Hold off on making important decisions when you are in a bad mood. Confirmation bias. Always look for conflicting evidence and then make judgments based on more well-rounded information.Ego depletion. When we're drained, physically or mentally, we're less likely to think critically.The halo effect says that once we like somebody, we're more likely to look for his or her positive characteristics and avoid the negative ones. Realize your biases toward certain people and do what you can to eliminate them.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Economics']
Title: Over-analyzing information Content: To overthink a decision may cause you to miss time-sensitive opportunities.Whether it’s due to fear or perfectionism, being indecisive and taking too much time to gather information not only affects the productivity of your business, but it also damages your employees’ confidence in you as a leader.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Teamwork', 'Leadership & Management', 'Remote Work']
Title: We Love A Good Story Content: The organic and unpredictable nature of conspiracy theories had led many researchers to investigate the cause of the phenomenon.Successful conspiracy theories always tend to invent a great villain, have a backdrop or a backstory, and a morality lesson that can be easily understood by most.Great stories are by nature more magnetic and appealing than the truth.Human beings think and understand in stories. For thousands of years, fairy tales, legends, anecdotes and mysteries have helped our brains make sense of the world.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Communication', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture']
Title: Conspiracies In Uncertain Times Content: Lack of knowledge and an uncertain, dangerous future creates the mental space for a conspiracy theory to flower. Such theories quickly come out of the blue whenever some crisis or major conflict happens.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Communication', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture']
Title: Fanatism and Conspiracies Content: The fanaticism associated with certain conspiracy theories and the extent to which many would even put their lives on the line points towards blind belief, the same kind of beliefs perpetuated by many organized religions, right down to the content, storyline and purpose.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Communication', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture']
Title: The Flow State Content: Is an optimal state of consciousness where we feel and perform our best. It happens when we are completely involved in an activity for its own sake. The ego falls away. Time flies. Your whole being is involved, and you’re using your skills to the utmost.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Time Management', 'Health', 'Habits']
Title: Kindness is a Mystery Content: The value of kindness, consideration and empathy towards others is a valuable social tool, which isn’t properly understood.An experiment shows that people can sense your attitude towards them if you are genuinely caring for them, even if you don’t show it by any visual cue or symbol.Your internal feelings of coldness or warmness towards others, somehow reciprocate in others, as if they are able to read your good (or bad) intentions.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Love & Relationships', 'Teamwork', 'Psychology']
Title: The Wealth Of Kindness Content: Capitalism has made us only understand one kind of wealth, as it is only concerned with the ‘monetary’ economy.Kindness and empathy towards others produce a different kind of wealth, which benefits everyone. Indifferences are quelled, and goodwill, warmth and support are produced.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Love & Relationships', 'Teamwork', 'Psychology']
"Title: Neuronal Correlates of Consciousness (NCC) Content: The whole brain can be considered an NCC because it generates experience continually. When parts of the cerebellum, the ""little brain"" underneath the back of the brain, are lost to a stroke or otherwise, patients may lose the ability to play the piano, for example. But they never lose any aspect of their consciousness. This is because the cerebellum is almost wholly a feed-forward circuit. There are no complex feedback loops.The spinal cord and the cerebellum are not enough to create consciousness. Available evidence suggests neocortical tissue in generating feelings.The next stages of processing are the broad set of cortical regions, collectively known as the posterior hot zone, that gives rise to conscious perception. In clinical sources of causal evidence, stimulating the posterior hot zone can trigger a diversity of distinct sensations and feelings.It appears that almost all conscious experiences have their origin in the posterior cortex. But it does not explain the crucial difference between the posterior regions and much of the prefrontal cortex, which does not directly contribute to subjective content."ㅇ['Health', 'Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Science & Nature', 'Philosophy']
Title: Popular Theories On Consciousness Content: We need a scientific theory of consciousness that can predict under which conditions any particular physical system has experiences. Any speculation about machine consciousness is based solely on our intuition, which is not a reliable scientific guide.Two of the most popular theories of consciousness is the global neuronal workspace (GNW), and the Integrated information theory (IIT).ㅇ['Health', 'Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Science & Nature', 'Philosophy']
Title: The Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) Content: GNW argues that consciousness arises from a specific type of information processing, known from the beginnings of AI, when specialized programs would access a small, shared repository of information.According to GNW, consciousness is when incoming sensory information is broadcast to multiple cognitive systems, which process these data to speak, store, or call up memory.The network of neurons that broadcast these messages is thought to be located in the frontal and parietal lobes.When the data is broadcast on this network, the subject becomes conscious.GNW proposes that computers of the future will be conscious.ㅇ['Health', 'Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Science & Nature', 'Philosophy']
Title: IP Development Content: A hackathon’s framework is a great way to surface, develop or identify new IP, as it provides a risk-free environment to crack a specific challenge or simply leave room for spontaneous brilliance.ㅇ['Teamwork', 'Leadership & Management', 'Startups']
Title: Optimism And Pessimism Content: If we expect others to be rude, impolite, backstabbing and untrustworthy, they won't really surprise us. It somehow makes our day easier, if we know it in advance. We understand beforehand that life is going to be hard, but we will handle it and learn from it. This is inner optimism but outer pessimism.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Mental Health', 'Communication', 'Psychology']
Title: Working With A Tool Content: As we started using tools, we realized that work, when it feels less arduous or even pleasurable, can be stimulating, rewarding and something we would love to do.Normal work makes us put aside our creativity, sensitivity, and other qualities to be productive, but a tool, if it is a delight to use, can become our insight into happiness.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Time Management', 'Philosophy']
Title: What We Love To Do Content: It’s not easy for most to find out what they love and to do that for the rest of their lives. Our education system is not of much help to us in terms of how our life should be.If we are somehow able to find what we love to do, what pays well, and what we are good at doing, we can find meaning in work, live a fulfilling life and not toil like our ancestors.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Time Management', 'Philosophy']
Title: Changes in Consciousness Content: Changes of consciousness may be a sign of medical conditions, for example, aneurysm, brain infection, brain tumor or injury, dementia, drug use, epilepsy, heart disease, heatstroke, low blood sugar, poisoning, or shock.If you think you are experiencing changes in consciousness, talk to your doctor.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Health', 'Science & Nature', 'Philosophy']
Title: The Hackathon Content: Is an event where people work tirelessly over a defined period of time to build something. Hackathons are most typically executed by engineers, but some companies have done hackathons with non-technical employees, such as sales.ㅇ['Teamwork', 'Leadership & Management', 'Remote Work', 'Personal Development']
Title: Going beyond short-termism Content: We often feel like we don’t have control over the future, that it’s this thing we’re just waiting to wash over us. But we do have control, but it requires strategic thinking and action on our part, imagining many possible futures, and thinking beyond our own lifespans.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Leadership & Management', 'Mental Health']
Title: A Hackathon’s Lead Time Content: Lead time is a preparation phase, from the announcement of the event to the actual ‘hack-time’. This is about communicating the event to the employees, attracting attention and enabling formal registration of interest.Employees should have a sufficient lead time to explore ideas, technologies, teams and resources. This is an informal preparation phase which should be supported by proper tools (systems to enable employees to structure their ideas, projects, teams; communicate their effort, ask for advice or help).ㅇ['Teamwork', 'Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: The Kaizen method Content: The Kaizen method is all about taking small steps into making your dreams come true. As we well know, changes can be scary and so can great expectations. Therefore, when trying to accomplish your goals, take smaller steps, so you can keep your motivation alive throughout the process.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Habits', 'Time Management', 'Productivity']
Title: Enjoy the process Content: While working your way out to your big goal, remember to enjoy the journey by learning as much as you can from it: notice and appreciate small moments, as these are the ones eventually leading to success. Take one step at a time and enjoy your life, as you are given only one.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Habits', 'Time Management', 'Productivity']
Title: LIIT (low-intensity interval training) Content: This is a new exercise phenomenon that claims you can still achieve similar fitness results to HIIT, but with lower risk of injury.Though there is currently no research on the effects of LIIT workouts, the idea is that you still perform exercises in intervals, but these exercises are done at a lower intensity and with more shorter rest time in between.ㅇ['Health', 'Exercise & Fitnesss']
Title: Keep going towards your goal Content: While discipline is necessary to achieve your target, so is the fact of removing any bad habit or rewarding yourself whenever you have accomplished something.Making a plan for your daily tasks can prove life-saving, as it will enable you to keep track of both your progress and mistakes.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Habits', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Time Management']
Title: Strategies To Build A Community Content: Build community around ideas to attract people and help your community to stand out.Fix what others are doing wrong. If you’re interested in an area inundated with bad networking options a solution we will attract people.Connect around shared experiences. Find something different about you that doesn’t have a local community. Search for specific similarities in groups over which you can immediately form a bond.Segment an existing group by finding a niche in existing networks. It’s easier and less competitive to build community at the cross-section of multiple interests.Change the mode of connection by ditching traditional meet ups, like happy hours and conventions. Do instead a fun activity based encounter, like playing a game.ㅇ['Business', 'Communication', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Startups']
Title: Setting Your Community’s Culture Content: Use your body language deliberately to set the tone and people will unconsciously adopt and spread your attitude. If you have speakers, ask them to buy in as well and if people aren’t buying in, that’s okay. They’ll self-select out.Also, your community needs to be safe. Your guests can cross the line and you need to be watchful for that. Make it clear inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated.ㅇ['Business', 'Communication', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Startups']
Title: Lesson 1: Practice, practice, practice Content: Leading up to the big speech at the end of the film, King George and his coach rehearsed over and over again–out loud!You have to practice out loud to get a feel for how the words will flow so that you can speak without hesitation.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Lesson 3: Determination conquers all Content: King George VI’s success was assured as soon as he made the decision to work hard to become a more effective speaker.One of the most important keys to improving is simple determination. If you’re serious about improving, you must speak regularly – at least once a week.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Why People Sign Up To A Community Content: The community aligns with their identity.They trust that the community will bring them value.They know how to participate.There is a reward (intrinsic or extrinsic) for their participation.ㅇ['Entrepreneurship', 'Teamwork', 'Business', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Build the Foundation of Community Content: Form the a community’s Identity: Carefully choose 10 potential members who fit the community identity you envision. They’ll set the standard of quality and the tone for everyone else.Earn Trust: The members can’t trust a community that doesn’t yet exist, but they can trust you. Connect with them, bring them value and ask for feedback.Fuel Participation: Start to build trust between the members. Their trust in you will translate to trust in each other, and in the group as a whole.Reward: Ask if the experience was valuable and if members felt rewarded for their participation. This gives them extra validation and lets you know what to fix if you need to retry.Repeat Steps 1-4: Invite new members and give existing members the opportunity to invite someone new. As the base of the group begins to settle it creates a sense of belonging and makes people more likely to invite others who will fit the group.ㅇ['Entrepreneurship', 'Teamwork', 'Business', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Courage: The non-biological factors Content: Non-biological aspect such as our psychological makeup, values, and beliefs, along with conditioning by early role models, can compel us to act at risk to ourselves in the interest of protecting other people.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Mental Health', 'Health', 'Psychology']
Title: The SEAL 40% rule Content: This rule states that people feel maxed-out mentally and physically, and so they stop when they are at only 40% of their actual capacity. Going past this 40% capacity is when it becomes uncomfortable.Thus, SEAL’s mantra, “If it doesn’t suck, we don’t do it.”ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Habits', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Time Management']
Title: True confidence is earned Content: And it’s earned by actually succeeding, not by wishing and thinking about success.  True confidence emerges when you regularly push-through things that are hard. The longer you sit with the boredom, pain, and discomfort, the more confident and successful you will be.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Habits', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Time Management']
Title: The lack of air resistance Content: Studies showed that running on a flat treadmill burned about 4 percent less energy, but that difference could be eliminated by setting the treadmill incline to 1 percent. Air resistance depends on how fast you’re going. If you’re running really fast, air resistance takes a bigger toll, which means that a really fast treadmill running is artificially easy by a larger amount. Conversely, when you’re running really slowly, air resistance is almost irrelevant.ㅇ['Health', 'Exercise & Fitnesss']
Title: There is no such thing as the ideal partner Content: Thus, you should give up the hope that you can be flawless and put together every day in a relationship.That idea is not realistic, puts you in a continuous state of feeling that you're not good enough, and can stop you from developing real confidence in yourself.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Personal Development']
Title: Being supportive Content: In relationships, there is usually one partner designated as the emotional rock. The risk with this: always being there for others can sometimes make you forget to take care of you.  The challenge is figuring out how to encourage your partner while holding on to your own identity and individuality.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Personal Development']
Title: Storytelling Content: Is the activity of writing or telling storiesand can empower one to convey a message in the strongest possible way. It’s a cultural and social activity that stimulates the imagination and builds a sense of wonder and community between teller and listener(s).ㅇ['Communication', 'Entertainment']
Title: Better Your Storytelling With Emotion And Reaction Content: Though a cartoon is two-dimensional, to make an emotional connection with the audience characters need action and re-action. Walt Disney had his artists focus on learning that.Too often presenters are so caught up in what they are going to say they never take time to add the “element” of great delivery which is expressing the emotion and reaction of our characters.ㅇ['Communication', 'Personal Development']
Title: Celebrate Content: After conquering their challenges characters are “reborn” with greater knowledge and power than before. They teamed up with friends to save others, and in the process saved themselves.What this means for you: Take stock of what you accomplished. Enjoy it.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Communication', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Save The Day With Friends Content: After all the lessons learned in the journey, characters can finally face their challenges. But sometimes even all the preparations aren’t enough and someone they help earlier in their journey unexpectedly comes to save the day.What it means for you: Never pass up an opportunity to help someone else. You never know when they will return the favor.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Communication', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Question Long-Held Assumptions Content: The beginning of the movie a character has assumptions about himself and his world but to face his challenge he has to question them and change his ways.What this means for you: Don't expect different results, if you don't change a thing.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Communication', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Choose Wisely. Wishes are limited Content: Once a character accepts the challenge, there might be a temptation to do too much or divert their attention to something else. That ends up causing complications.What this means for you: Remember why you set off on this journey in the first place and don’t get sidetracked.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Communication', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Closing A Hiring Pitch Content: Bring the hiring pitch home with personal stories that show how people authentically live out your company’s mission. Pixar’s films often start from a real, personal story.Your company’s big-picture mission might be inspiring, but it’s not necessarily personal. You can make it more personal by peppering your pitches with personal anecdotes about ways that you’ve changed.ㅇ['Communication', 'Movies & Shows', 'Career', 'Marketing & Sales']
Title: Data Versus Emotion As Convincing Tools Content: Companies tell stories because they stir up feelings, and that’s what makes these brands memorable. Similarly, recruiters shouldn’t sell jobs as a dry collection of responsibilities and perks—you should strive to bring the role alive through stories that evoke strong feelings.Pixar movies never flatly tell you the theme of the story—they make you experience them. Facts, figures, missions and visions by themselves aren’t nearly as memorable, impactful, or personal as a story can be.ㅇ['Communication', 'Movies & Shows', 'Career', 'Marketing & Sales']
Title: The Self: Buddhism vs Science Content: Buddhist teachings state that nothing is constant, including the self. The notion of an ever-changing self, where the body and the brain are constantly in a state of flux, is now being supported by scientific research.According neuroscience papers, there is scientific evidence to show that our brain is always in self-processing mode, extending to a diverse range of fluctuating neural processes.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Health', 'Psychology', 'Science & Nature', 'Philosophy']
Title: Rules of storytelling, according to Pixar Content: Emphasize trying more than success.Having an initial theme while writing is important but don’t get too attached to it.Cutting things out is important part of the writing process.Challenge your characters with their polar opposite.Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle.Putting it on paper lets you start fixing it. If it stays in your head, a perfect idea, you’ll never share it with anyone.Audiences don’t like passive/malleable characters, so give yours opinions.Imagining what you would do in the place of your character helps you lend credibility to unbelievable situations.Give the consumers reason to root for the character. Stack the odds against them and make the stakes clear.Story is testing, not refining.Coincidences to get characters into trouble are great; coincidences to get them out of it are cheating.Trying to rewrite a movie you dislike into one you like without messing too much with the structure is a good exercise.Summarize the essence of your story. If you know that, you can build out from there.ㅇ['Communication', 'Reading & Writing', 'Personal Development']
Title: History of charismatic leadership  Content: In medieval times, leadership was mostly based on tradition. Most people never met their leaders and leadership was legitimized by the divine right of kings - charisma was not needed.The 19th and the 20th century were full of charismatic leaders.  Technological (newspaper, radio, and TV) allowed leaders to transport their charisma over long distances. Our current globalized world and access to social media have led to another rise in charismatic leaders. On Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, many people support leaders solely based on their charisma.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Teamwork', 'Psychology', 'Communication', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Save time by not deliberating pointlessly Content: If the issues on the table have been reasonably vetted, the choices are equally attractive, and there is still no clear answer, then admit that there is no clearly identifiable right way to go and just decide.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Time Management', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Inner Awareness and AI Content: ... or self-awareness is something many scientists and philosophers are discussing. The fact that there is consciousness inside us, is a big problem for those developing AI, as no matter what they do, and how technologically superior the product is, nobody can explain or even fathom the juggernaut of consciousness.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Health', 'Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Science & Nature']
Title: Qualia: Experiencing Sensations Content: Qualia relates to the raw sensations of experience, like colours, smells, sounds.It is through our actual experience that we know what something tastes, looks or smells like, and it is not some information already drilled inside our brains on birth. We have to experience sensations to understand them.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Health', 'Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Science & Nature']
Title: Trying To Define Consciousness Content: The consciousness can be entirely physical, a product of the brain.It is an independent, unique entity, a special feature of physical reality, and can be a different reality in itself.Everything that exists has some form of ‘proto-consciousness’, or varying levels of consciousness, as stated in the old theory of panpsychism.Consciousness is non-physical, existing as a dual entity, connected to the physical brain at some metaphysical level. This non-physical substance is also called the ‘soul’.As believed by eastern religions for thousands of years, consciousness can be the ultimate reality, whereas our physical reality could just be a subset of the same.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Health', 'Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Science & Nature']
Title: Pitfalls Of Metrics Content: Just like statistics, anything with numbers can be selective honesty.If the click-through-rate or the percentage of people clicking on your ad is increased, does it mean better earnings? It won’t work if the ad is just a false click-bait.If people spend less time on your app, does it mean it is a failure? That can also mean it gets the job done fast, and depends on what your app is supposed to do.Certain metrics provide information that is irrelevant or disposable, wasting our time.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Product & Design', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Marketing & Sales']
Title: Mentor #1: The Master of Craft Content: They are like actual Jedi masters who possess wisdom acquired from experiences.Turn to this person when you need advice about launching a new initiative or brainstorming where you should work nextㅇ['Personal Development', 'Teamwork', 'Career', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Viking Content: NASA's Viking 1 was the first man-made object that soft-landed on Mars in July 1976.The Viking 1 lander is also the longest-running Mars surface mission, and sent the first color pictures back from the surface of Mars,ㅇ['Science & Nature']
Title: Why Seek Out a Mentor Content: A mentor is not someone who gives you direct answers, but someone who challenges you to know the right answer.And in life, you can't be spoon-fed all the time. The role of a mentor is to guide you and give you the wisdom in knowing the answer.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Career', 'Teamwork', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: The Mystery Of Consciousness Content: For a long time, the question of consciousness itself has been kept off the table, and cannot be ignored any longer, as any breakthrough in science points to reality being subjective.If we look at objects in the universe in terms of atoms, we will come to the conclusion that some atoms form objects that become conscious, while others don’t. It is difficult for science to suddenly explain away consciousness, something they have neglected for eons. The explanatory gap is too big if they acknowledge consciousness.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Health', 'Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Science & Nature']
Title: Own Your Role Content: Once you've identified the pattern, be accountable for your part. It is more than just apologizing. Own your role and then change your behavior. How could you do it differently?The more responsibility you take for your part in your relationships, the more likely you are to recognize and make necessary changes.ㅇ['Communication', 'Love & Relationships', 'Personal Development']
"Title: Slow Down the Conversation Content: Focus on clearly conveying your whole emotional message and try to hear the whole of the other person's without thinking it is an attack.Saying ""I feel like you..."" instead of ""You never/You always..."" can lead to a more productive discussion."ㅇ['Communication', 'Love & Relationships', 'Personal Development']
Title: A Chance for Change Content: The best thing about knowing you have a problem is the opportunity to fix it.Using our struggles within our relationships can help us discover parts of ourselves that need healing and growth. It can lead us to become better friends, partners, and people.ㅇ['Communication', 'Love & Relationships', 'Personal Development']
Title: When influence is manipulative Content: Influence is manipulative depending on how it is being used.If the manipulator attempts to get someone to adopt what the manipulator himself regards as wrong, it resembles lying. The liar tries to get you to choose a false belief or to make a mistake in what he thinks, feels, doubts or pays attention to.ㅇ['Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Love & Relationships']
Title: Slow Adoption of Flexible Work Content: Today, remote and flexible work arrangements are seen as a perk.In 2018, a survey showed that around 3% of Americans worked from home on a regular basis. Due to technological advancements (starting with Blackberry), employees were working from everywhere, the subway, the café, home and during the commute.But even after we have the technology required for remote working for about fifteen odd years, we have been slow to adopt mainstream remote working. The mass-adoption needed a catalyst, and that was provided in 2020 in the form of a deadly disease.ㅇ['Teamwork', 'Corporate Culture', 'Remote Work', 'Career']
Title: Missing Face-To-Face Interactions Content: While remote work has a lot of benefits like reduced commute, time efficiency and safety, many conclude that the richness of in-person interaction is irreplaceable, and many studies do seem to confirm that people in the office just get more done.Face-to-face interactions help employees communicate and bond, making them think, investigate, synthesize, write, plan, organize and brainstorm together, something the best of technology finds hard to match with people in remote locations in their pyjamas.ㅇ['Teamwork', 'Corporate Culture', 'Remote Work', 'Career']
Title: The Faceless Employee Content: In many remote working environments, employees are reduced to their email addresses and/or slack handles, delegated with work which can easily overload them due to the current unstable situation across the world already complicating life, and most people having their kids at home.Offices, on the other hand, have the advantage of the personal touch, with long back and forth emails are usually avoided, with a spontaneous conversation working out well.ㅇ['Teamwork', 'Corporate Culture', 'Remote Work', 'Career']
Title: IT Sector and Remote Work Content: The software industry is already organized towards a systematic work approach that is compatible with remote working, which involves agile project management systems and coding sprints, understanding the needs of the coders.ㅇ['Teamwork', 'Corporate Culture', 'Remote Work', 'Career']
Title: Asking for professional help Content: Sometimes eliminating external stressors just isn't enough. When you find yourself in a prolonged state of stress, it’s time to get the help of a professional. Chronic stress can have a negative impact on your quality of life and can also make physical health issues worse.ㅇ['Health', 'Personal Development', 'Mental Health', 'Communication']
Title: Data and how it frames your thinking Content: What’s more important than how much data you have is how it frames the way you think.Some leader when they're under pressure to appear decisive, approach complex situations with simple rules or analogies, selectively using data to justify poor judgment calls.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Effective communication Content: ... is imperative for every successful business. Poor communicationinevitably causes misunderstandings, confusion and conflicts that hinder productivity and professional relationships.ㅇ['Communication', 'Teamwork', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Worst Communication Mistakes Content: Using a One-Size-Fits-All Communication Approach. Tailor the communication style to the intended audience.Speaking More and Listening Less.Listen to what is said,how it is said,and towhat is not said.Assuming Instead of Asking More Questions.Using Negative Tone. Choose words carefully to eliminate negative reactions.Avoiding Difficult Conversations.Reacting, Not Responding.Not Keeping an Open Mind. Accept and respect differences, listen without judgment and consider all sides of an issue.ㅇ['Communication', 'Teamwork', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Probability Content: Most of us understand probability and the likelihood of certain things to happen, or not happening, but still do not fully believe in it. For us, it’s about right and wrong, black or white.Example: Nate Silver(a numbers guy) said in 2016 that Hillary Clinton has a 72 percent chance to win. This didn’t mean he was wrong when Clinton lost, but most people believed he was.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Money & Investments', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Avoiding Difficult Conversations Content:  It's tempting to try to avoid difficult conversations, but this can cause further problems.Preparation is key to handling difficult conversations.Use tools such as the Situation – Behavior – Impact   technique to encourage your people to reflect on their behavior.Role-play your conversation first.ㅇ['Communication', 'Teamwork', 'Personal Development']
Title: A Sinful Or Virtuous Life Content: A life of satisfying one’s appetites, like material wealth, lust, power is a life suitable to beasts and is a laughable way to live.A rational life with empathy, virtuosity and courage is the pursuit of eudaimonia in an everyday setting.Though fate or luck does play a role in our long-term happiness, it by no mean hinders our quest for individual self-realization, with adverse situations and circumstances performing the role of a catalyst, not a hindrance.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Philosophy', 'Problem Solving', 'Communication']
Title: Implementing psychological well being Content: Eudaimonic activities that can be practically pursued:Seeking to pursue excellence in one’s life.Following one’s beliefs.Using one’s core competencies.Learning or gaining insight into something.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Philosophy', 'Problem Solving', 'Communication']
Title: Storify Your Resume Content: Instead of spilling words with no head or tell, try to incorporate compelling before-and-after stories in your resume.Your Hero's Journey can include your earlier companies (when you were a fresher), the challenges you faced and how you overcame them. You can add how the organizations are better because of you and can elaborate when needed, using bullet points.ㅇ['Career', 'Communication', 'Personal Development', 'Product & Design']
Title: The Choice Mindset Content: Rather than getting influenced by the limited set of options provided to you by the other party (which tricks you into a vortex of limited options), it is better to adopt a choice mindset. One has to let go of the internal limitation of having no choice (which is an illusion, of course). There is always a choice, there is always an option.Taken to an extreme, this illusion is what triggers suicides, as our limiting mind feels that there is no choice except ending one’s own life, which is entirely false.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Problem Solving', 'Marketing & Sales', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Ignore The Ultimatum Content: Thinking about choices makes us ignore the false ultimatums provided by the other party. Have the inner confidence to believe that there is still room for negotiation to get what you want, instead of being lulled into thinking that you have to compromise.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Problem Solving', 'Marketing & Sales', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Avoid Personalization And Self-Blame Content: A manipulator’s agenda is to exploit your weaknesses, it is understandable that you may feel inadequate, or blame yourself for not satisfying the manipulator. In these situations, it’s important to remember that you are being manipulated to feel bad about yourself and that’s not your fault nor is the problem at hand.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Love & Relationships', 'Communication', 'Parenting']
Title: The Blues Of Being Mentally In The Future Content: A lot of anticipatory happiness and the resulting grief if the plans do not materialize is due to the fact that most of us are not in the present moment, but are mentally somewhere in the future, where we think we would be really happy. Staying in the present moment, then becomes a necessary skill.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Time Management', 'Problem Solving']
Title: Roots Of Media Manipulation Content: Media manipulation exploits the difference between perception and reality using the still remaining trust for truthful content it once had.

How?Community: How to set up communities for success.Channels: Where and how to engage with users outside the core product.Monetization: How to sustain what you're doing.ㅇ['Product & Design', 'Startups']
Title: Using templates Content: With the growth of your organization, consistently message the same things again and again. Templates ingrain this practice.For instance, at Reddit, whenever you're about to run a test, you already have the format of an email to explain what you're testing. The template consists of fields where you'll insert the results.ㅇ['Product & Design', 'Startups']
Title: Preventing rigidity Content: Pick only a few hard-and-fast rules.Provide autonomy between firm commitments.Be clear about the role of product ops.Just start. Rather start something in ops than to have a master plan and the process figured out. Start light.ㅇ['Product & Design', 'Startups']
Title: The utility fallacy Content: Is the tendency, when evaluating the impact of a technology, to confine your attention to comparing the technical features of the new technology to what it replaced.For example: No one argues that it’s better to send an email than a fax. But the modern knowledge worker now sends 125 business emails a day, which works out to one every 3.85 minutes —more back-and-forth communication than what was common in the pre-email era. This new behavior is not “better” in any useful sense.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Teamwork', 'Corporate Culture', 'Time Management']

After all, your new friends will like you for everything you represent, not only what they perceive as being familiar.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Love & Relationships']
Title: Not framing your remarks  Content: In general, the higher up the audience, the less detail you should be providing. Frequently, executives get tuned out when they report to higher levels and provide too much detail about their topic.FIX: Cater your comments to the highest level person in the room, and address what he or she will find valuable. Put the details in an appendix or have them ready so they're available, and you can easily pull them out if asked.ㅇ['Communication', 'Career', 'Teamwork', 'Personal Development', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Being overly agreeable Content: This occurs when we want so much to be a likable team player that we come across as a yes person. Every idea is great, each deadline is possible, and new projects are all upside.FIX:When you find yourself tempted to state agreement even though you don't feel it, express your true opinion. You can still say this politely, and rather than simply say what you can't do, let the person know what you can do, and believe to be the best solution for all.ㅇ['Communication', 'Career', 'Teamwork', 'Personal Development', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: You don’t paraphrase or restate Content: Practice paraphrasing instead of responding with nods, a-ha's, and yeah's.This type of communicating makes your partner feel like they are getting real attention and empathy.For example:If they are talking about a conflict they had at work say, “So it sounds like you are frustrated because your boss didn’t acknowledge how hard you worked on that project.”ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Communication']
Title: Alone time Content: Researchers tested how the rhythm of our communication can influence our problem-solving. The participants were divided into three groups.Groups with continuous interaction had a good average performance, but the team members tended to conform to mediocre solutions.People working independently didn't have the opportunity to benefit from other's solutions.The intermittent communication group was the best of both worlds. They could build on the diversity of the ideas that were created independently.ㅇ['Teamwork', 'Remote Work', 'Corporate Culture', 'Personal Development', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Working well Content: Virtual teamwork places greater emphasis on communication and organization.Over the short-term, newly formed virtual teams experience more negative outcomes, such as team conflict, lower satisfaction, less knowledge sharing, and poorer performance.

"Title: History of the paradigm shift Content: Psychologist Jean Piaget saw children's development as a series of separate stages marked by periods of adjustments. Inspired partly by Piaget, Thomas Kuhn - a physicist, philosopher, and historian of science -proposed two kinds of scientific change:Incremental developments in the course of ""normal science.""Scientific revolutions that accentuate the more stable phases.He proposed that scientific revolutions are not a matter of incremental progress; they involve ""paradigm shifts."""ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Philosophy', 'Economics']
"Title: Various distinct senses Content: The term paradigm can be used in many distinct senses. For example:A paradigm could refer to a special kind of achievement that draws an enduring group of adherents away from competing modes of scientific activity, but is open enough to leave all sorts of problems for the new group to solve.Paradigms can be used to offer general epistemological viewpoints, like a broad sweep of reality, when it ""determines large areas of experience at the same time.""What Thomas Kuhn meant originally by paradigm has, over time, assumed an expansive set of meanings, sufficiently open-ended to allow other possibilities to be explored."ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Philosophy', 'Economics']
Title: Creative Thinking Defined Content: Creativity is not just reserved for artistic tasks such as writing, painting or composing music.Creative thinking isthe ability to consider something – a conflict between employees, a data set, a group project – in a new way.Itinvolves lateral thinking-the ability to perceive patterns that are not obvious.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Creativity']

Title: Two Strategies For Decision Making Content: Implementation Intentions: A pre-planned, pre-configured response, that is automatically coming when you are triggered or coaxed into doing something that you don’t want to.Future Self Concept: Asking your future self the same decision that is put on you, instead of answering it with your current self.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Time Management', 'Habits']
Title: Gestures: A Warning System Content: Gestures act as an early warning system for intent, emotion, and mood. Our body language precedes the desire of our conscious minds. Our bodies know what we want before our conscious minds do.So it's useful to watch others' body language to know what they're thinking, desiring, and feeling. In turn, we have to learn to listen to our unconscious mind. It's telling you that you're hungry, angry, bored, happy, and content.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Health', 'Communication']
Title: We all need to learn to separate our happiness from our achievements Content: It’s okay to feel content with our lives simply because we have an inherent sense of self-worth.Reaching our goals can obviously bolster this feeling and give us a deep sense of accomplishment, but the absence of achievement should not mean the absence of happiness.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Health', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Mental Health', 'Habits']
Title: The costs of walling ourselves off Content: Once we slap a label on others, we don’t bother to look more closely, and our fears grow.We are actually less safe. Labeling entire groups of people as good guys or bad guys is dangerous, because we end up accidentally putting white hats on bad guys and black hats on good guys.We waste precious resources. Trying to wall ourselves off from entire groups of people is exhausting and inefficient.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Psychology', 'Problem Solving']
Title: Conditioning a habit Content: 2 main ways you can condition a habit:Classical conditioning: a paired association with a trigger and a behavior. Going to the gym after you wake up each morning is this kind of habit.Operant conditioning:you not only associate a trigger with a behavior, but you reward that pairing, toaccelerate the habit-forming process.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Time Management', 'Habits']
Title: The 30-Day Trial Content: You commit to some change for 30 days, then tou can go back to your old ways.

Title: Tattletale Tactics Content: This strategy works by deputizing others to enforce your habit for you.Pros:No formal rules or mechanisms are required, just the social pressure from the outside.If you find yourself constantly breaking your own commitments, this may be the only tool you can use to effectively control your behavior.Cons:Most people won’t care about your behavior as much as you should.Doesn’t work if others aren’t watching you while you perform the habit.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Time Management', 'Habits']
Title: Rewarding To Maximize Motivation Content: The expectation of rewards may decrease the spontaneous interest in the activity to be rewarded. So it’s important to understand what the rewards should be and how they should be awarded to avoid this side effect.Rewards should go beyond the usual healthcare and salary raise to provide a good work environment. The ideal is a corporate culture that recognizes good employees with nice perks and words of encouragement, but also provides a setting where people can grow, be heard, take ownership of their work and feel they have a purpose.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Leadership & Management', 'Career', 'Human Resources']
Title: Understanding how long food lasts Content: Should humanity face a nuclear apocalypse of worldwide war, we need to understand which foods might be safe for survivors to eat, and how long the foods will last.To understand this, we need to ask what makes food spoil.ㅇ['Food', 'Health', 'Personal Development', 'Science & Nature']
Title: Potential foods Content: Twinkies will last no longer than similar treats. One Twinkie has been kept in a time capsule for up to 44 years.Honey is almost impossible to spoil because it is high in sugar and low in water. Some honey samples are 3,000 years old.Very fat-rich foods like butter and cheese, tallow or oils can last for a long time. Bog butter, a highly fermented butter, is up to 4,000 years old.The world's oldest champagnes, 200-year-old bottles of Clicquot, was perfectly palatable.Ancient frozen flesh may look perfectly edible but quickly becomes putrid after defrosting.Fish is even worse at surviving the freezing process.

Title: Worry is like junk food Content: Just like the body craves calories, the mind craves control. In fact, we can fool our minds into thinking we’re actually solving a problem by running it over and over and over again in our minds. And to make things worse, like junk food, worry also happens to be constantly available, dirt cheap, and instantaneous.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Health', 'Mental Health', 'Habits', 'Psychology']
Title: The illusion that we are taking action Content: Worry briefly feels good, especially compared to the alternative—doing nothing and just feeling afraid. Worry feels good because it gives us something (rather than nothing) to do. And this makes us feel a little less helpless and out of control.We may not be able to actually do anything about a problem, but worrying about it makes us feel like we’re doing something.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Health', 'Mental Health', 'Habits', 'Psychology']

New technologies can create a buffer against pressures such as climate change.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Economics', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture']
Title: Examples of the zero-sum bias Content: People sometimes view membership in social groups as being zero-sum: belonging to one social group excludes you from being a member of a different group.People sometimes view gender hierarchies in the workplace as being zero-sum, which can cause them to be more opposed to gender-fair policies.People sometimes believe that there is an inherent zero-sum competition between different ethnic groups, which can cause them to develop negative attitudes towards immigrants.People sometimes view racism as a zero-sum game, meaning that they believe that a decrease in racism against one group will be balanced by an increase in racism toward other groups.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychology', 'Communication', 'Love & Relationships']
Title: How to avoid the zero-sum bias Content: To reduce the degree to which you experience the zero-sum bias, you need to identify cases where you assume that a certain situation is zero-sum, and then assess the situation rationally in order to identify whether it is actually zero-sum, which you can do, for example, by asking yourself whether a resource under consideration is truly limited.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychology', 'Communication', 'Love & Relationships']
Title: Avoid using ‘ I need..’ Content: Whenever we hear the ‘I need…’ words, we all tend to get a bit irritated by this way of being requested to provide something that always seems of the most utter importance. On the other hand, there are expressions which could easily replace the ‘ I need…’ while giving the other person the impression that everything is under control.ㅇ['Business', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Career', 'Marketing & Sales']
Title: Accidentally insulting someone Content: Maybe you sent a text or email to the wrong person that included a less than positive opinion of the person who just received it.Don’t make up an excuse or try to backtrack; a candid conversation will lead to forgiveness much faster than a bunch of BS.Apologize only if you care.

All of these processes occur simultaneously, some more automatically and with less conscious awareness than others. If we were to give all of them the same amount of focus and attention, they would overwhelm us.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Health', 'Problem Solving', 'Time Management', 'Communication']
Title: Make employee experience a priority Content: 96% of talent professionals agree that employee experience is very important, to the point of becoming mission-critical.Whether you’re a leader overseeing a 500-person organization or a manager with a team of two, we all need to find ways to create experiences to connect more deeply and humanly with our teams..ㅇ['Corporate Culture', 'Career', 'Communication', 'Leadership & Management']

It could take some time and cumulative action to build a more diverse workforce, but sometimes the simplest of measures can add up to major changes.At Shopify, for example, the company rethought the requirements on their job descriptions. On each job post, it encourages job seekers to apply even if they don’t necessarily meet all the requirements that are listed.ㅇ['Corporate Culture', 'Career', 'Communication', 'Leadership & Management']

Title: Propuestas de resolución  Content: La parálisis del análisis surge cuando se generan pensamientos inútiles y excesivos. Es darle vueltas a los problemas para verlos desde todos los ángulos, pero sin trazar propuestas de acción y, aún menos, de resolución. El análisis no es útil porque jamás trazamos un plan ni generamos ningún tipo de respuesta. Al final, quedamos bloqueados, atrapados en esa sobrecarga mental.ㅇ[]

Title: Pros and consof a competitive or intense company culture Content: Belfort's employees worked extremely hard due to Stratton Oakmont's culture. This effort led to high output and a high standard of work. On the other hand, people made moral sacrifices for achievement.When there is such a high degree of intensity, especially with money involved, people can make poor decisions. A balance is important when thinking about company culture.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Movies & Shows', 'Leadership & Management', 'Career']
Title: Take life a little less seriously Content: Belfort and Stratton Oakmont made so many crazy decisions. While they paid the consequences for those choices, and this is by no means worthwhile, they also had a ton of fun.Running a company is extremely challenging.

"Title: The Psychology Of Color: Research Findings Content: Up to 90% of snap judgments made about products can be based on color alone (depending on the product).Colors influence how consumers view the ""personality"" of the brand in question.Our brains prefer recognizable brands, which makes color incredibly important when creating a brand identity.Predicting consumer reaction to color appropriateness in relation to the product is far more important than the individual color itself.The context a color is used is fundamental for its perception.It’s the feeling, mood, and image that your brand create that play a role in persuasion.The majority of consumers prefer color patterns with similar hues, but favor palettes with a highly contrasting accent color."ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Product & Design', 'Marketing & Sales']
Title: Philosophers were the first therapists Content: Philosophers teach us to think about our emotions, rather than simply have them. By understanding and analysing our feelings, we learn to see how emotions impact on our behaviour in unexpected, counterintuitive and sometimes dangerous ways. - Alain de Bottonㅇ['Personal Development', 'Philosophy', 'Communication', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychology']
Title: Engagement Content: As children, we are remarkably aware to the world around us. This attention wanes over time as we allowmore pressing responsibilities to attend to and demands on our minds to address. And as the demands on our attention increase so, too, does our actual attention decrease.As it does so, we become less and less able to know or notice our own thought habits and more and more allow our minds to dictate our judgments and decisions, instead of the other way around.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Health', 'Communication', 'Mindfulness']
Title: Observation Content: Before we include something in our brain attic we must first observe it.It’s not just about the passive process of letting objects enter into your visual field.

Title: Quantum Cognition Content: The 1994 book Shadows Of The Mind by physician Stuart Hameroff suggests that the neurons of our brain and most of our cells contain protein strands called microtubules which may be responsible for quantum-level cognition. However, this process is easily nullified by its interaction with the surrounding environment and is known as decoherence.The fact that the nerve signals or electrical impulses have interaction possible at the quantum level in the brain and is easily destroyed by outside influence, runs parallel to the earlier ‘Double-Slit’ experiment.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Science & Nature']
"Title: Workspace Temperature Content: Cornell University researchers found that by increasing office temperature from 68 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit (20° to 25° Celsius), workers' typing errors fell by 44 percent, and they were able to type 150 percent more.If you can't control the temperature in your office, there's always the ""wear a sweater"" option or getting a small fan if your workspace is too warm."ㅇ['Time Management', 'Health', 'Productivity', 'Personal Development', 'Remote Work']
Title: Office Sound Content: It's hard to drown all that out when you're trying to work. A good pair of noise-canceling headphones could help.

The latter taps into research that suggests ambient noise can increase creativity.ㅇ['Time Management', 'Health', 'Productivity', 'Personal Development', 'Remote Work']
Title: Common Mistakes Content: Not making time to assess the mess.If you can, build in 15 minutes at the end of the day to put everything back where it belongs.Confusing the process of throwing away with actually getting organized.

Title: A Cauldron Of Emotions Content: Grief involves anger and loss of emotional control, often a state of confusion.Anticipatory grief, for those who experience it, is sometimes even more severe and stressful.

Title: Emotions work like spectacles Content: It's a huge help to know which lens you’re seeing the world through, at any given moment.

"Title: Increase Your Knowledge Base Content: It's rarely worth it to condense your knowledge into a specialty.You should be broad in your knowledge. Holmes says that you should have a clean ""brain attic,"" but he's also a walking encyclopedia of knowledge. He reads incredibly broadly—he reads about art, music—things that you would think have no bearing on his detective work. I think that's an important lesson that we can take. It's bad to overspecialize, and we should try to remain as curious about all the different types of things you want to learn. -- Konnikova"ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Health', 'Habits', 'Learning & Education']
Title: All Stories Are Possible — Until They Are Not Content:  Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot encourages everybody to tell their story.

However, we should prepare one or two things to shoot back at the critic when they next come calling.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Communication', 'Mental Health']
Title: Every story has two sides Content: You could tell everything as a tragedy, or you could tell an equally valid and far kinder story. You could say that you made some serious errors, as every human will, and you paid the price for them. Nevertheless, you tried to be good and loved a few people properly.

Title: Different types of brain waves Content: Specific frequencies are thought to be involved in specific cognitive tasks. During deep sleep, the predominant brain activity occurs with frequencies between 1 and 4 Hertz (delta waves.) Delta waves are associated with learning and motivation. Theta waves (4-7Hz) are linked to memory and emotional regulation.Brain entrainment - where brain cells fire at the same frequency - is a real effect that happens in response to particular rhythmic frequencies perceived by our senses. A deep-pitched musical tone can cause your brain cells to start firing at the same frequency.ㅇ['Health', 'Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Science & Nature']
"Title: Research conclusions on binaural beats Content: The authors played binaural or monaural (normal) beats to 16 participants, and recorded their brain activity with EEG.They found both beats can entrain the brain to their particular frequency, but participants described no significant effect on their mood changes. However, binaural beats can generate ""cross-frequency connectivity,"" where the brain coordinates its activity across different types of brain waves. It's then possible that binaural beats can be beneficial to some types of cognition, including memory recall.An analysis of 35 studies demonstrated a modest effect on attention, memory, anxiety, and pain perception. However, these were not tested in the current study."ㅇ['Health', 'Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Science & Nature']

Immediate threats activate the panic alarm, while anticipating a threat sometime in the future involves the anxiety alarm.ㅇ['Health', 'Personal Development', 'Mental Health', 'Psychology']
Title: Our brain when we're afraid Content: A perceived threat sends information to the brain's emotional processing and learning center, called the amygdala. The amygdala sorts out the data within tens or hundreds of milliseconds. If it registers the threat, then it fires off a series of physical changes. Heart rate, breathing, and sweating increase in the fight-or-flight response because the body is preparing to flee or to fight if escape is impossible.ㅇ['Health', 'Personal Development', 'Mental Health', 'Psychology']
Title: Best way to get over fears Content:  A healthier way to cope involves facing the fear.Getting over a fear is an active process that requires learning and retraining the brain. Essentially, you are training higher-level brain areas to overcome signals from areas like the amygdala so that you can put threats into a more realistic context.ㅇ['Health', 'Personal Development', 'Mental Health', 'Psychology']

Title: Learning languages: embrace mistakes Content: You can’t ever truly “learn” a language, you get used to it. It’s not a thing that you know or don’t know; it’s a means of communication between human beings. Languages should not be acquired by rote alone—they need to be used.One of the best things you can do in the initial stages is not to try to get everything perfect, but to embrace making mistakes.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Learning & Education']
Title: Every day feels the same Content: You must find joy in the repetition.You do that by taking those reps and making them mean something.Add some variety in by breaking your comfort zone. Set a goal to do something wild during your day every so often: travel, meet new people, learn a new skill. And even so, you have to accept some level of repetition.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Habits', 'Communication']
Title: Why your goals matter Content: We’re more likely to get something done when we take a moment to think about why it matters to us personally.Intrinsic goals are motivated by values meaningful to you, such as growth and relationships. These are much more motivating than extrinsic goals—efforts motivated by money, status, or other external factors.ㅇ['Time Management', 'Personal Development', 'Habits']
Title: Focus On The Positive Parts Content: We tend to focus on giving employees critical feedback. But, by focusing on their weaknesses, we only create competence. By focusing on their strengths, we create excellence.Give equal measures of positive and negative feedback. We usually gloss over the strengths, but focus in great detail on the critical feedback. Add examples and details to your positive feedback.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Mental Health', 'Communication']
Title: Show Compassion Content: Rather than seeing the feedback situation as “work” or a hassle, see it as an opportunity to connect with someone who has their own needs and pain.

Title: Understanding How We Relate To Others Content: The Attachment theory claims we have different ways of behaving with regards to commitment and intimacy, and this is related largely to our upbringing and life experiences. One can know the various attachment styles and see where they fit into, having a better understanding of their reactions towards others.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Love & Relationships', 'Psychology']
Title: Don’t Take Disappointment Personally Content: We fear others' reactions as if others are going to be disappointed by us on a personal level. The disappointment need not be taken personally as the other person may be upset at the situation or towards the outside world, and how their plan did not work out.Do not over-analyse the situation, and base your actions on your core values.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Love & Relationships', 'Psychology']
Title: The Transylvania Effect Content: The academic literature in the 90s termed the effect of the lunar cycle on humans and even entire populations as the Transylvania Effect.

Title: Knowledge Exists On A Barometer Content: Continuously shifting depending on who you are talking to.Treating knowledge as concrete (a noun)  suggests there is a specific point at which what you know becomes an absolute truth. When knowledge becomes a process, a fluid verb instead of a concrete noun, our worldview changes.Knowing more about a subject doesn’t necessarily mean that you are right. We need to be able to measure the quality of information we possess.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Communication']

Title: What separates growth from stagnation Content: Research on violinists shows that those who went on to become concert performers didn't practice more, but the time spent in deliberate practice was much higher.Deliberate practice means trading automatic behavior for strategies to increase performance.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Learning & Education', 'Strategy', 'Time Management']
Title: How to avoid getting stuck Content: Change to more challenging environments where your performance is no longer adequate. It will put you back on the learning curve.Get a coach to get access to high-quality instruction and feedback.

In writing, pick one sentence and rewrite to make it more clear.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Learning & Education', 'Strategy', 'Time Management']
Title: Having a weak drive to learn Content: Without a drive to learn, it's hard to get going. Weak drives include expectations from family, teachers, or employers. It's the things you have to do, but don't want to do.You can change this, but you need an inspiring goal to get you started. If your project doesn't excite you, no advice will help.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Learning & Education', 'Personal Development', 'Productivity']
Title: Problems of anxiety when learning something Content: Sometimes you are excited to learn, but you still avoid getting started. You may worry about the fear of failure, feedback, or performing. If you expose yourself to the thing you find unpleasant and nothing bad happens, your fear will lessen.Reframing is often helpful in overcoming this problem. Begin each studying session with the idea that you will find it hard.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Learning & Education', 'Personal Development', 'Productivity']
Title: When it is not fun Content: Either the process is enjoyable, or you feel accomplished when you are finally done or you have reached a milestone.On the flip side, there are situations or projects that you dread starting, you hate the process, and when you are finally done, you wish you never did it.

Title: Overthinking  vs. problem-solving Content: If you’re proactively trying to gain a new perspective, you might find thinking about an issue is helpful. If you’re repetitively thinking about how you wish things were different or imagining all the things that could go wrong, you’re overthinking.Is there a solution to this problem? Some problems can’t be solved.Am I focusing on the problem or searching for a solution?What am I accomplishing by thinking about this?ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Mental Health', 'Problem Solving', 'Health', 'Psychology']
Title: The generative flow mindset Content: Is where you let ideas come to you easily and you don’t look at them too critically. This mindset is expansive, relaxed, open and positive.The advantage of this flow is that you create a lot of ideas.The downside is that a lot of them are bad.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Reading & Writing', 'Creativity']
Title: Cognitive maps. Content:  Introduced in 1948 by psychologist Edward Tolman of the University of California, Berkeley, a cognitive map is our mental representation of our physical or psychological spatial environment.

Title: Mindful Wakeup Content: First thing in the morning:Close your eyes and connect with the sensations of your seated body.Take three long, deep, nourishing breaths—breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth. Then let your breath settle into its own rhythm,Ask yourself: “What is my intention for today?” and then set that intention.Throughout the day, check in with yourself. Pause, take a breath and revisit your intention.ㅇ['Mindfulness', 'Health', 'Personal Development', 'Meditation']
Title: Our brains are programmed to procrastinate Content: It’s easier for our brains to process concrete and immediate outcomes rather than abstract and future things.So the short-term effort easily dominates the long-term upside in our minds— behavioral scientists call thispresent bias.ㅇ['Time Management', 'Personal Development', 'Productivity', 'Problem Solving']
Title: Empathy Mindset Content: It gives us the ability to put ourselves in other people’s shoes so we can see and feel from their perspective:Listening to how you're colleagues explain what they are thinking will give you valuable context.Showing sincere appreciation and celebration of others’ contributions allows you to show that you value them.Self-Awareness, an understanding your own biases and limiting beliefs.Presence.

This requires negotiation and persuasion.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Career', 'Teamwork', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Doing Is Not Accomplishing Content: Many of us fall into the trap of thinking that if we’re busy doing something, we’re being productive.But “doing” is sometimes just a form of procrastinating.ㅇ['Time Management', 'Productivity', 'Personal Development', 'Remote Work', 'Problem Solving']
Title: Too Much Time on Email Content: We rarely actually take care of the email in the box,we just move it around as a sort of “reminder system,” which in reality usually only serves to create stress when you open your inbox.Set aside time to tackle your email, including unsubscribing from lists or newsletters you no longer value, and see how your productivity improves accordingly.ㅇ['Time Management', 'Productivity', 'Personal Development', 'Remote Work', 'Problem Solving']
Title: Plan Your Own Time Content: The constant bling and buzz of our phone, email and texts can make it almost impossible to concentrate on what we’re working on.

Title: Thinking Multitasking Is Effective Content: When you’re tackling your to-do list, you’re probably trying to do more than one task at once.Recent research has shown how multitasking does not help you get more done.ㅇ['Productivity', 'Time Management', 'Personal Development']
Title: Writing The List In The Morning Content: Although it might feel natural to create your to-do list first thing in the morning, it's too late.Writing the list at the end of the day allows you to leave work behind and transition into personal time.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Productivity', 'Time Management']
Title: Including Too Many Tasks Content: Ideally, create a ‘top three’ tasks at the beginning of your to-do list.Long lists are a problem because most people aren’t aware that “we only have about three to six good hours of work in us each day.”People also tend to underestimate how long a task takes.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Productivity', 'Time Management']
Title: Treating Each Item Equally Content: If it’s not a priority, it should not be on the list.Follow the 3-3-3 system when writing out your list:Delete three of the items since they probably aren’t that important.Delegate three of the items to someone else, as they are not the best use of your time or talents.Do three of the items that are the highest priority.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Productivity', 'Time Management']
Title: Not Being Specific Content: Be as specific as you can be, so that when you’re taking on a task on the fly, you can just get it done.For example, instead of writing “expense report” on your to-do list, write “enter receipts into spreadsheet.”And skip the vague-sounding action words, such as “plan,” “implement,” or “develop” from your list of tasks.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Productivity', 'Time Management']
Title: Picking up multiple habits simultaneously Content: Cementing a new habit takes time and discipline.Integrate a single habit at a time. That way, you are more likely to establish it and, once cemented, you could consider picking up the next habit.ㅇ['Time Management', 'Productivity', 'Personal Development', 'Habits', 'Problem Solving']
"Title: Bring out the ""best of yourself"" Content: Make a conscious effort to bring out the best in someone else through your communication.This makes communicating less ""me-centric,"" which is talking to hear yourself talk, or talking ""at"" someone rather than ""with"" them, or being more interested in wanting to ""capture"" their attention for some kind of pay off."ㅇ['Communication']
Title: Painting with words Content: Consider communication as an empty canvas to paint with words, think of all of the wonderful and beautiful things you can say to another person.It's helpful to know that what we say to someone else, might not be what we would want said to us.ㅇ['Communication']
Title: Be Responsive, Instead of Reactive Content: Realize how distorted our views of other people can be when we react defensively.When we can open up and see another person in a fresh way, our own self-image transforms.Learning how to switch out of defensiveness into a more humorous, receptive state of mind is a big deal—it is the key to happy, harmonious relationships and communities.ㅇ['Communication', 'Personal Development', 'Mindfulness', 'Mental Health', 'Psychology']
Title: Listen Content: To mindfully listen means to wait patiently for the other person to finish before we speak. Also, it means keeping our mind focused onthe speaker, instead of wandering away.ㅇ['Communication', 'Love & Relationships']
Title: Be totally there Content: Not being present during communication can range from checking smartphones, watching TV or engaging in anything else during the actual discussion.To have a successful communication, we should put our activities aside and totally be with the person who’s talking.ㅇ['Communication', 'Love & Relationships']
Title: The first response Content: When it’s time to respond back, we tend to reply with a personal answer. We either tell a personal story or explain how we intimately feel about it.The first response must relate to the speaker. “I understand” can be a good place to start. Then we can ask the person how they feel about it, what they are going to do, or ask them to elaborate.ㅇ['Communication', 'Love & Relationships']
Title: Let go of results Content: We should engage in conversations more lightly if we truly wish to mindfully communicate.Not taking things personally and responding in a non-aggressive way are good baby steps toward accomplishing this goal.ㅇ['Communication', 'Love & Relationships']
Title: Food affects the environment Content: Eating healthy food is almost always also the best for the environment.Researchers say poor diets seriously harm people and the planet. Foods such as fruit, vegetables, beans, and whole grains are best for avoiding disease and protecting the climate and water resources, while red and processed meat cause the most ill health and pollution.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Science & Nature', 'Marketing & Sales']
Title: A healthy guideline Content: Global ill-health costs from diabetes alone are similar to the total value of farming in the global economy.Researchers calculated that producing unprocessed red meat has the highest impact on all environmental indicators.Food with medium environmental impacts or not associated with ill health, such as refined grain cereals, dairy, eggs, and chicken, could help improve health and reduce environmental harm if they replace foods such as red meat.Producing a reasonable guideline for a healthy and sustainable diet would put the world and its people in a much better place.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Science & Nature', 'Marketing & Sales']
Title: How to shop for a clean diet Content: Whole foods come first. Wholefoods don't need labels with ingredients. Cut or eliminate ultra-processed foods that contain synthetic chemicals, pesticides, and artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives.Choose minimally processed foods. It is food where, if you wanted to, you could find all the ingredients and make it yourself.Focus on healthy oils such as olives and avocados.Where you can, choose organic and no added hormone milk, cheese, yoghurt, and butter.Select meats, poultry, eggs, and seafood with no hormones administered or antibiotics added.Take care when choosing plant-based proteins as an alternative to meat as they can be highly processed and contain fillers, preservatives, and artificial ingredients.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Psychology', 'Marketing & Sales']
Title: Your decision will never be final Content: You must be aware that however much critical thinking you apply to a decision, you may be wrong.Being comfortable with being wrong, and knowing that your opinions and knowledge of a situation will change with time, brings a sense of true inner freedom and peace.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Mental Health', 'Habits', 'Psychology']
Title: Get perspective Content: Solve another person’s problem first.Helping others puts your issues in order by reminding you that we all go through tough times, some much more than you ever will.That’s not to discount the struggles you’re going through, but helping others will restore balance and harmony in your life.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Mental Health', 'Habits', 'Psychology']
Title: 1,700 distinct varieties of cheese Content: Animal milk is used to create over 1,700 distinct varieties of cheese; creamy Brie, buttery Gouda, crumbly Parmesan, stringy mozzarella, sharp Cheddar, to name a few.The staggering variety of cheeses is testimony to cheesemakers' creativity throughout the ages, but the real stars of the show are the microbes.ㅇ['Health', 'Food']
Title: From milk to cheese Content: All cheeses start from animal milk, including cow, buffalo, goat, sheep, and even camel.The milk is first warmed to a temperature ideal for microbes to flourish.Next, acid or rennet is added, alongside some 'starter' bacteria that causes the milk proteins and fats to coagulate, curdling the milk.The curds can be drained and chopped into chunks and scooped into moulds.The initial 'starter' bacteria die off over several weeks and other microbes take over to enhance the flavour that creates the potent flavours and aromas.Salt is added to stop microbes responsible for spoiling the process.The 'ripening' microbes break the proteins in the cheese into amino acids, many of which have their own flavour.Particularly voracious bacteria and fungi will break down amino acids even further to produce the truly smelly by-products.ㅇ['Health', 'Food']
Title: Craving cheese Content: Our food-obsessed minds crave novelty. When we have a new flavour offered, the desire to try something novel is irresistible.There are also some scientific-sounding claims that cheese is as addictive as cocaine because it contains opium-like chemicals called casomorphin peptides.ㅇ['Health', 'Food']
Title: Put things into a wider perspective Content: When you are thinking and thinking about something ask yourself: Will this matter in 5 years? Or even in 5 weeks?It allows you tostop thinking about something and to focus your time and energy on something else that actually does matter to you.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Health', 'Habits', 'Problem Solving', 'Mindfulness']
Title: Become a person of action Content: When you know how to get started with taking action consistently each day then you’ll procrastinate less by overthinking.Set deadlines and a good tone for the day.Take small steps forward and only focus on getting one small step done at a time.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Health', 'Habits', 'Problem Solving', 'Mindfulness']
Title: Analysing signatures Content: Specific claims linking aspects of handwriting to personality continue to emerge.A 2016 study that looked at personality tests and signatures reported that, among men, a larger signature correlated with having more social bravado, while in women, a more prominent signature correlated with having narcissistic traits.ㅇ['Communication', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Health']
Title: We need better words Content: Bassi, a 47-year-old theoretical physicist at the University of Trieste, in northeastern Italy, is prominent among a tiny minority of rebels in the discipline who reject this conclusion. “I strongly believe that physics is words, in a sense,” he said across the picnic table.ㅇ['Science Fiction']
Title: Entanglement Content: Schrödinger coined a term — “entanglement” — the wave functions of any two interacting objects, including observer and observed, get wove into one. This puts a researcher probing the subatomic world into a position similar to that of one water droplet trying to deduce the dimensions of another by touching it: Since the end result is one big droplet, the observing droplet can work out the volume of the observed (by subtracting its own initial volume from that of the big droplet) but can’t glean its original shape. Entanglement could be responsible for keeping objective reality behind a veil.ㅇ['Science Fiction']
Title: Key principles of intuitive eating Content: Reject the diet mentality. The diet mentality is the idea that there’s a diet out there that will work for you.Respond to your early signs of hunger by feeding your body.Food is not good or bad and you are not good or bad for what you eat or don’t eat.Respect your fullness.

Thinking about all of the load at once will make you feel defeated.Don’t tell yourself there’s this huge amount of things you have to do right now. No, there’s one thing, and then another.

If you don’t finish all the tasks today, that’s absolutely fine.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Habits', 'Mental Health']
Title: The things out of our control Content: There are things that we can’t do anything about, and that’s life, a game of luck and skill. The skill( and decision part) you can control, along with how you feel about it.Things like losing one’s job, or having a family member who is sick, are out of our control, and it is no use draining our energy worrying about it. You need to focus on things you can control, like your attitude towards adversity.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Habits', 'Mental Health']
Title: Studying involuntary imagination Content: At first, pareidolia (seeing shapes in clouds and in other inanimate objects) was seen negatively rather than a sign of creativity. It was even considered to be a symptom of psychosis or dementia.In 1895, French psychologist Alfred Binet - known for his work on IQ tests - suggested that inkblots could be used in psychological research to study differences in involuntary imagination. This idea was further developed, resulting in inkblots to investigate people's personality and assess their psychological state.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychology', 'Health', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture']

"Title: The Importance of Socratic Ignorance Content: The best way to change dogmatically held beliefs is to start with a skeptical attitude and ask questions, assuming you know nothing.However, it is questionable how feasible it is to keep an attitude of Socratic ignorance on all matters. Even Socrates says, for instance, that he is sure that no real harm can befall a good man. He is equally confident that ""the unexamined life is not worth living."""ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Philosophy', 'Communication', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture']
Title: Own the emotion Content: You can’t change an emotion you don’t own.Accept responsibility for its existence.Because an external event always precedes your experience of an emotion, it’s easy to assume that the event caused it. But as long as you believe it was externally caused, you are going to be a victim to your emotions.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Mental Health', 'Communication', 'Psychology']
Title: Writing helps your memory Content: When you take notes, you need to filter external information, summarize it in your head, and then write it down.Your brain decides which pieces of information to hang onto for later, partly as a result of how much work you do to them upfront–so the more you mentally manipulate a piece of information, the better you’ll remember it.ㅇ['Time Management', 'Productivity', 'Personal Development']
Title: Control stimuli Content: Acting independently begins with what you let into your mind—meaning what comes in from your environment. If you are lacking agency, it’s likely your attention is being hijacked and you need to figure out how to restore it.To help you increase your control, practice going to quiet and screen-free spaces to escape overstimulation.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Mental Health', 'Health', 'Habits']

Title: Sleep Content: Sleep is not just about rest. It’s the period where the mind is shut off and reset.When we sacrifice sleep, we also sacrifice creativity, self-control, and attention span.

Title: Lack of motivation leads to passive behavior Content: The most common cause of passive behavior is being unmotivated.It is a myth that motivation needs to come before action. More often, it is action that leads to motivation. You forced yourself to get in your workout gear and then suddenly felt ready to go.

Motivation and productivity will follow behind.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Habits', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Time Management']
Title: Analysis paralysis and passivity Content: Anything that involves analysis can cause passive behaviour. Analysis paralysis is so common today due to the numerous sources of information available. You can spend hours analysing expert opinions instead of just doing and learning through experience. Reading expert books on how to ride a bike is not the same as getting on the bike.Your brain will give you reason after reason why you should continue to analyse. However, listen to your intuition and ignore your intellectual impulse to have all the details figured out first.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Habits', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Time Management']
Title: The good form of  “passive” Content: Passivity is not always bad. Passive can also relate to peace, contentment, creativity, and inspiration.

Title: Being proactive, not reactive Content: An effective way to stop being passive is not to react to other people and situations as soon as they happen. When we immediately react to an issue, we may often respond angrily or view a situation bigger than it really is.Instead, watch your reactivity. How do you respond to unexpected situations?

Title: The principle of Psychoprofessional Gravitation Content: It is the idea that if you reach professional heights and are deeply invested in being high up, you can suffer greatly when you inevitably decline.In many professions, we may reject the inevitability of decline before a very old age. But the data are clear that for most people, in most fields, decline starts earlier than expected. According to research, success and productivity increase for the first 20 years after the inception of a career. If you start a career at 30, your best work will be produced around 50, and decline after that.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Health', 'Philosophy']

Title: Overvaluation of negativity  Content: We tend to be more passive in life than we would be if we weighed negativity and positivity the same.Bad outcomes seem to weight more in terms of punishment than good outcomes weight in terms of benefit, so it can seem sensible to speak out and try new things as infrequently as possible.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Career']
Title: Introverted Content: I'm not saying introverts should never push themselves to attend social events that they're not really feeling up for going to, and I'm by no means saying that introverts should never step outside of their comfort zones, either. Actually, studies show that pushing yourself to act more outgoing once in a while is good for everyone — whether you're an introvert or not. However, part of finding happiness as an introvert is accepting that you're an introvert, and then celebrating all the reasons why that's awesome.The whole reason introverts can't seem to keep up with the social lives of extroverts is that the over-stimulation and near-constant social activity that extroverts thrive off of is exactly what usually stresses introverts out.So if you're not feeling a party, leave it. If you'd rather have a deep conversation with one or two people at a party instead of working the room with surface chit chat, do it! You'll feel happier, and it's a much healthier option than trying to be someone you're not.I've certainly been guilty of this one myself. Of course, part of my reasoning for this comes from my fear that pissing off my server will lead them to somehow negatively impact my experience at the restaurant; but it's also just because, as an introvert, I hate confrontation.To be fair, I don't think anyone really enjoys confrontation, unless they're just super toxic. But since introverts usually have a difficult time speaking up in the first place, confrontation can be extra hard for us. If this is the case for you, I get it. But that doesn't mean it's healthy for you to go through life keeping your mouth shut. Don't allow yourself to be so afraid of causing a scene that you don't ask for what you need — whether that's a vegan burger instead of an all-beef one, or a raise, or better sex.Take it from someone who's been there: you never need to become so self-conscious about being an introvert that you don't act on your already-rare desires to socialize in group settings. I know it's hard sometimes, but just be your weird, awkward, introverted yourself! Not that this really matters, but chances are, the outgoing extroverts you meet will probably find your quirkiness more endearing than off-putting anyway. Or, they simply won't give your unique brand of introversion a second thought, because they'll be too busy being extroverted.ㅇ['Psychology', 'Mindfulness', 'Mental Health', 'Meditation', 'Love & Relationships']

"Title: Deficiency vs. Growth Content: Abraham Maslow argued that all needs could be grouped into two main classes: deficiency and growth.Deficiency needs are motivated by a lack of satisfaction, such as the lack of food, safety, affection, belonging, or self-esteem. The higher the need, the more we change reality to satisfy the most deficient needs.Growth needs have a different sort of wisdom. Instead of being driven by fears and anxieties, it is more accepting and loving. It is asking, ""What choices will lead me to greater integration and wholeness?"" rather than ""How can I defend myself?"""ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Communication', 'Problem Solving']
Title: Forming a faulty deficiency mindset Content: At a young age, when an expression of a need is disregarded as not as important as the needs of the caretaker, a child may get the message that they are not loved while they have this need.This causes people to behave in a way they think they should feel, not how they really feel. As adults, they are always influenced by others' opinions and driven by their insecurities and fears of facing themselves.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Communication', 'Problem Solving']
Title: Offer various types of workspaces Content: Providing a mix of multiple workspaces, including open space, has been shown to improve employee engagement because people can choose the right area for the task at hand.For example, you can offer a living room area with comfy couches, as well as a library area for reading and intense focus. Provide booths for private phone calls, as well as individual workstations or “home bases” for team members to set up shop.ㅇ['Time Management', 'Productivity', 'Corporate Culture', 'Teamwork', 'Career']
Title: How depression is measured Content: Depression is often measured by scientists using something called theHamilton Scale.It runs from 0 (where you are dancing in ecstasy) to 59 (where you are suicidal).Improving your sleep patterns gives you a movement on the Hamilton Scale of around 6 points.Chemical antidepressants give you an improvement, on average, of 1.8 points, according to research by professor Irving Kirsch of Harvard University.ㅇ['Health', 'Mental Health', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology']

Title: The self-interested action Content: A self-interested action is one that is motivated to serve your own interest. You drink water because you have an interest in quenching your own thirst. You show up for work because you have an interest in being paid.Psychological egoists think they can explain actions that do not seem self-interested. A motorist who stops to help someone who has broken down may believe that they too may need help one day.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Love & Relationships', 'Communication', 'Psychology']
Title: Objections to psychological egoism Content: The most obvious objection to psychological egoism is that there are numerous clear examples of people putting others' interests before their own. Although psychological egoists think they can explain seemingly virtuous actions, their theory rests on a false account of human motivation. The fact that someone feels virtuous after performing a good deed may be true, but it is often just a side effect of their action. They didn't necessarily do it in order to get those feelings.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Love & Relationships', 'Communication', 'Psychology']
Title: Selfish vs. selfless action Content: A selfish action sacrifices someone else's interests for their own. For example, grabbing the last slice of cake.An unselfish action is where you place another person's interests ahead of your own. For example, you offer someone the last piece of cake, even though you'd like it for yourself. If you get satisfaction out of helping others, that sort of desire is unselfish.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Love & Relationships', 'Communication', 'Psychology']
Title: Why psychological egoism is appealing Content: It satisfies our preference for simplicity. In science, we favour theories that explain several phenomena by showing them to all be controlled by the same force. Newton's theory of gravity gives one principle to explain a falling apple.It offers a seemingly cynical view of human nature. It appeals to our concern not to be naive.To the critics, the theory is too simple. Being hard-headed is not a virtue if it means ignoring contrary evidence. Most of us have a natural concern for others, perhaps because we are social beings by nature.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Love & Relationships', 'Communication', 'Psychology']
Title: Speak Up Content: If things are incredibly difficult, or if you need to take more time off than your mental health days allow, you may need to say something to your employer.Don’t feel obligated to disclose details. If you’re taking a lot of time off or you’re worried others will wonder what’s going on, you can tell them that you’ve been “dealing with some health issues” and leave it at that. Or, consult with HR to determine the best approach.ㅇ['Health', 'Mental Health', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology']
Title: Ways to deal with depression Content: Understand the common triggers.Once you understand which one is behind your depression, you can better learn how to cope with depression.Feelings of loss, “less than” and “never going to happen” are the major reasons that most people dip into depression.

Title: Address your limiting beliefs Content: Many of those trying to find ways to deal with depression have formed limiting beliefs that negatively affect how they think.If you come from a family who has never had a member attend college, you might believe that you are not smart enough to achieve your goals. Another common limiting belief is that they are supposed to be sad because depression or anxiety runs in their family.ㅇ['Health', 'Mental Health', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology']

Title: Take a mental health break Content: It's hard when you can't function as well as you're used to, but slogging on doesn't work when you're in a downward spiral.When you're at a crossroads in terms of your mental health, you need to really say, 'OK, I'm going to ask for five days off.That might mean the difference between me not having a mental health breakdown, or needing to take additional time off.ㅇ['Health', 'Personal Development', 'Mental Health', 'Psychology']

Title: The rubber balloon Content: Michael Faraday made the first rubber balloons in 1824, for use in the laboratory. He laid two sheets of rubber on top of each other, put flour in between to prevent them from joining all the way, then sealed the edge together. When Faraday filled the balloons with hydrogen, they had reasonable ascending power, but he was disappointed that the hydrogen kept escaping.Thomas Hancock, a British inventor and rubber manufacturer, began distributing balloon-making kits, and by 1847, London entrepreneurs were selling the first balloons made of vulcanized rubber. Not long after, the idea was exploited for the use at parties.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'History', 'Science & Nature']

Title: How much humans can eat Content: One study asked healthy participants to eat pizza until they felt full. Then on a separate day to eat pizza until they couldn't anymore. They ate twice as much as on the first take, suggesting that when you feel full, you're probably only half full.Blood samples were also taken at regular intervals to see how the body was coping. Despite eating twice as much food, there was only a small increase in blood sugar and blood fat levels.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Exercise & Fitnesss']
Title: Long-term overeating Content: Healthy humans rely on the body's ability to work harder in times of need. However, when we repeatedly eat too many calories at each meal, metabolic syndrome - a combination of high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity - will result. Over time, the body will become unable to react to these situations.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Exercise & Fitnesss']

Title: Friendships  Content: In childhood, friends are mostly other kids who are fun to play withIn adolescence, there’s a lot more self-disclosure and support between friends, but adolescents are still discovering their identity, and learning what it means to be intimate.During young adulthood, friendships become more complex and meaningful. They're more likely to seek out friends who share their values on the important things.The middle-agedpersons define friendship as “being there” for each other but reported that they rarely had time to spend with their most valued friends, whether because of circumstances or through the age-old problem of good intentions and bad follow-through.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Love & Relationships', 'Communication']

This is known as Division Of Labour in simple economics.If household chores are done by the one who is able to do them well, then one person ends up doing almost everything.ㅇ['Economics', 'Productivity', 'Love & Relationships', 'Time Management', 'Personal Development']
Title: Game Theory In Household Chores Content: A fair and equal division of labour using a method in game theory called ‘I Divide, You Choose’ creates a level playing field while making the person who is not adept at a certain task strive hard to level up the required skill sets.Example:  When dividing a piece of pastry between two kids, if one kid is told to divide the treat in half and the other is provided with an opportunity to choose which half is whose, then the first kid will ensure that the division is fair and equal.ㅇ['Economics', 'Productivity', 'Love & Relationships', 'Time Management', 'Personal Development']

These variables are called the degrees of freedom.A worthy theory of quantum gravity has to minimize the degrees of freedom.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Science & Nature']
Title: Gravity Is Incalculable Content: While performing quantum calculations, certain infinite terms appear, making these theories ‘non-renormalizable’.Theories that are describing the forces of nature other than gravity, can easily be renormalized(put to scale) and that makes gravity an anomaly. Gravity, for the most part, becomes a special force of nature that cannot be calculated.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Science & Nature']

Title: Recessions are far from equal Content: Banks are better able to handle a financial crisis than a decade ago. The 2008 recession was about the housing market and shares, which affected higher income groups.The present crisis seems to be hitting the lower-income groups, the vulnerable workers, young, and less skilled. It is similar to the late 70s, early 80s recession, which affected young and unskilled workers.Another lesson from 2008 is that recessions don't always lead to significant numbers of job losses. Layoffs were concentrated among a small number of people, and they stayed unemployed for a long time.In this recession, far more workers will be at risk if social-distancing rules remain in place over a long period.ㅇ['Money & Investments', 'Economics', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture', 'Books']
Title: GDP during a crisis Content: A drop in GDP was expected during the 2020 lockdown. Shops and businesses were closed, and the total value produced by goods and services decreased. In turn, this affected the staff of those businesses earning less money.Furloughs. At its peak, about nine million people in the UK were paid a furlough - the government paid 80% of their salaries, and the employer could choose to top up the rest. Other countries have similar state-backed furlough schemes. These schemes will be coming to an end, and employers will have to decide if they have to lay off employees permanently.The losses are not yet crystalising. People are taking mortgage and credit holidays. It means the losses are pushed further down the road. The financial sector bubble will burst, and we will see real turmoil again.ㅇ['Money & Investments', 'Economics', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture', 'Books']

Statements like, “They’ll never give me a shot, ” or, “They’re going to know I’m too…, ” are good examples.Don’t assume what’s going on in others’ heads–especially of those “others” who haven’t told you directly that you’ve got a limitation.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Habits']
Title: Limitations And Well-Being  Content: The more you push at your limitations the more the world becomes your canvas. Art helps people see the world in a different way.To make the world your canvas, try to think of people who you can help today.

Title: Yogurt  Content: It’s made by adding bacteria to milk, which can soothe several gastrointestinal ailments.

Title: “Natural” Content: This term is not yet regulated or clearly defined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), so it has no true meaning.ㅇ['Health', 'Psychology', 'Marketing & Sales', 'Food']
Title: “Organic” Content: Food labeled as “organic” isn’t automatically the healthiest option. While organic foods can be healthful and contain fewer pesticides, organic versions of junk food are still filled with sugar, sodium, and fat.Don’t cast aside all other principles of healthy eating when buying organic.ㅇ['Health', 'Psychology', 'Marketing & Sales', 'Food']
"Title: Organic Content: The term organic doesn't necessarily mean healthy, as evidenced by organic candies and baked goods. Once again, when buying packaged food, the real litmus test is the ingredient list.TheOrganic Seal indicates that food was produced without industrialized substances and under humane conditions. It goes from “100% organic” to ""Made With Organic Ingredients""(the product was made with a minimum of 70% organic ingredients, with restrictions on the remaining 30%, including no GMOs.)"ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Psychology', 'Marketing & Sales']

Title: Maximize your brain's performance Content: Building a brain-exercise routine will probably be successful if it mirrors the most successful ways to create any other routine.The answer to maxing out your brain’s performance abilities for the rest of your life lies in how you exercise it—just like your body.ㅇ['Health', 'Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Habits']
"Title: The ‘Draw-Down Period’ Content: Before he would jump into an idea and go full steam, take areflective period to step back ask yourself: ""What do I really have here? Do I actually have something? What am I hoping to accomplish?”"ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Leadership & Management', 'Strategy']
Title: Adopt Systems & Processes Content: With a system in place, you can better do the most essential job of a strategist:think long term.To put into practice your vision, you need systems, routines and rituals—structures that prevent you from sliding off the track.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Leadership & Management', 'Strategy']
Title: Research On ‘Health Halos’ Content: Protein bars are perceived as having an increased protein content and as healthier overall when the label reads “protein bar“ and “good source of protein. ”ㅇ['Psychology', 'Health', 'Marketing & Sales']
Title: Health Buzzwords Content: ... like ‘protein’, ‘paleo’ and ‘organic’ are used in marketing as key selling points for many of today’s health products. Yet these words can also trick consumers into believing a product is healthier than it really is.Inaccurate health messages can be dangerous as they don’t help to educate consumers to make informed choices and are often in conflict with credible, accurate health information.ㅇ['Psychology', 'Health', 'Marketing & Sales']
Title: The Arranger Content: A natural-born facilitator.You’re highly intuitive and communicative.You do your best work with people and on teams, and you understand instinctually what needs to get done to wrap up a project.Productivity Boost: Youneed to intersperse solo work with group work. Spending the entire day holed up in an office will actually backfire.ㅇ['Time Management', 'Productivity', 'Personal Development']
Title: Empowered By Having Personal Information  Content: When we gossip, we gain “social capital” -- a secret weapon of sorts over those around us.Even if we have no intention of using information in a harmful manner, simply having the information is satisfying.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Love & Relationships', 'Teamwork']
Title: Relating To Each Other Content: Sharing your viewpoints on other people with someone helps the relationship grow stronger.We want to engage with people who share common opinions, no matter how snarky. You may not be discussing deep subjects, but you’re definitely having fun.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Love & Relationships', 'Teamwork']
Title: Keeping Us Safe Content: We ensure our well-being by exchanging information about the world around us (and the potential dangers it contains) with as many people as possible.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Psychology', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture', 'Love & Relationships']
Title: Gossiping Content: It is talking about a person who isn’t present. It's not necessarily about spreading malicious rumors or embarrassing stories, just sharing information.Research indicates that the typical person spends about 52 minutes per day gossiping. But most of it is just sharing information about the people in their lives with those around them.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Psychology', 'Love & Relationships']
Title: The Benefits Of Gossip Content: Gossip doesn’t only teach us about the person who’s the subject of the conversation, but also about the gossiper. When you gossip you tell others things about your attitudes, beliefs, and ways of dealing with people by seeing who and what you gossip about.When you do join in, gossip can also strengthen your social bonds.It improves a group's cooperation and makes members less selfish, as well as a way of identifying and ostracizing untrustworthy individuals until they learn the lesson.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Psychology', 'Love & Relationships']
"Title: The Negatives Of Gossiping Content: If you gossip negative things, like insulting someone or talking down their achievements, it may put both you and the person you are talking to at risk of losing the group’s trust and each other’s strength.Speaking your mind about someone can also result in ""spontaneous trait transference. "" According to psychologists, this is when people are perceived as possessing the traits they are describing in others."ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Communication', 'Health', 'Love & Relationships']
Title: Conflict mistaken for passion Content: Arguments and disagreements in relationships are normal, but screaming matches and every day fighting isn’t.People who seek out conflict in their relationship for the intense reconciliation are often addicted to the dopamine that they get after the fight is over – which isn’t healthy for either person.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Communication', 'Personal Development']
Title: Keeping score Content: Keeping track of the things that you do, versus the things that they do is away to create pressure and conflict where there should only be teamwork.Sit down together and work out a plan on things like chores or bills, and who does or pays what.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Communication', 'Personal Development']
Title: Needing to be “completed” Content: When we think that we need someone else, especially a romantic partner, to complete us and make us whole, it shows an unhealthy degree of dependency on another person.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Communication', 'Personal Development']
Title: Complaining or Encouraging Content: If your partner is taking on a new challenge or trying to solve a problem or fix something that’s broken, do you complain about their success and pace or do you offer encouragement and act as a cheerleader?Improve your partner’s chance of success by giving them space and positive encouragement. You should view yourselves as a team, not as rivals.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Personal Development', 'Communication']
Title: Bribing or Negotiating Content: When you want to convince your partner to do something your way, do you try to bribe them with promises of giving in to their requests later?Healthy adult relationships don’t function well when disagreements feel more like payoffs than negotiations or mediations.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Personal Development', 'Communication']
Title: Consciously practicing gratitude makes one happier Content: It makes one appreciate what one has and helps one to remain in the present moment. Practicing gratitude increases accountability which directly leads to higher self-esteem and happiness.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Mental Health', 'Love & Relationships']

But in many cases, the indicators of a toxic relationship are much more subtle:Persistent unhappiness, negative shifts in your mental health, personality or self-esteem, feeling like you can’t talk with or voice concerns to your significant other.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Communication', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology']
Title: Blaming Your Partner Content: ... for your own emotions.This is a subtle form of selfishness and a classic example of the poor maintenance ofpersonal boundaries.Take responsibility for your own emotions and expect your partner to be responsible for theirs.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Communication', 'Personal Development']
Title: Covering up problems with gifts Content: Never use gifts or fancy things to replace dealing with the underlying emotional issues. Not only does it brush the real problem under the rug, but it sets an unhealthy precedent within the relationship.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Communication', 'Personal Development']
Title: Touch often Content: Communication is not only verbal. Hold hands. Kiss him or her hello and goodbye. Let your partner know without words just how much he or she means to you.Touching coupled with the right language can add depth to your relationship that words cannot.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Communication']
Title: Remain open Content: Problems tend to build as opposed to disappearing when we keep issues that are bothering us bottled up inside.If you’re having a problem, raise it with your partner, bearing in mind your delivery.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Communication']
Title: Compliment your partner Content: Little acknowledgments here and there communicate to your partner that you notice him or her and are happy he or she is a part of your life.If your husband cooked you a special dinner, acknowledge it. If your wife had her hair done, tell her how lovely she looks.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Communication']
"Title: Increase your ""insignificant"" experiences Content: Simply spending time together doing unimportant and supposedly meaningless activities—reading the paper, listening to music, watching TV, or doing laundry—can be more important to the health of a relationship than talking about feelings."ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Communication']
Title: Don’t get defensive Content: There’s a difference between seeking the truth versus automatically getting defensive.When an argument arises, you should both work from the position of 'what can we do to move our shared life forward?’ instead of investing energy into showing why one point of view is correct and the other one is not.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Communication', 'Personal Development', 'Career']
Title: Ask open-ended questions Content: While there are plenty of situations where closed-ended questions are appropriate, couples who consistently communicate with open-ended questions, to spark “big talk,” show that they have a sincere interest in their partners and want to create closeness.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Communication', 'Personal Development', 'Career']
Title: Don’t use extremes Content: Accusations such as “you always…” or “you never…” drain the flavor out of a relationship, making your partner feel like a zero.Use criticism with pin-point accuracy and avoid the collateral damage that comes from the sweeping generalizations.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Communication', 'Personal Development', 'Career']
Title: Mind your language Content: How you say something is as important as what you say.Do not use extremes. Accusations such as, ‘you never,’ ‘you always’ do not add any value to your argument.Use ‘I’ statementsemphasizing how you feel,rather than ‘you.’Validate your partner’s feelings. Invalidation happens when you recognize your partner’s feelings but then discount, belittle, ignore or minimize them.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Communication', 'Personal Development']
Title: Focus on the positive Content: Experts recommend that for any conversation, you should have a 5 to 1 ratio of positive to negative statements.Comparing your partner negatively to someone will be counterproductive to your discussion. Also, stay away judgment words and loaded terms.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Communication', 'Personal Development']
Title: Gain Flexibility Content: If you view things as unchangeable, then nothing can change for the better.

Title: Take a Shower Content: Anecdotal evidence links shower to creativity.So maybe when the status quo response to some circumstance just isn’t working, try taking a shower.ㅇ['Communication', 'Personal Development', 'Teamwork', 'Career']
Title: Learn About Other Religions Content: Religions are a way for us to understand our relationships with the supernatural and with each other. Learning how such relations are structured can teach you a lot about how people relate to each other and the world around them.Seeing the reason in other religions can also help you develop mental flexibility.ㅇ['Communication', 'Personal Development', 'Teamwork', 'Career']
"Title: Draw a Picture as a Team Content: However bad it looks, draw a picture of your challenge and possible ways to solve it. Drawing engages your right brain and can release the hold your logical left brain has on thinking about the issue or ""the box"" the same way."ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Creativity']
Title: Keep your cool in heated situations Content: Don’t let anger overcome you. Nothing constructive results from anger. Anger only obstructs judgement and mental clarity.If you train yourself to remain calm in stressful situations, you will grow strong and resilient.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Mental Health', 'Psychology']
Title: Limit Choices Content: The paradox of our time is that we have so many choices available to us that many of us struggle to make any choice at all.Counter this by purposefully limiting your options at times.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Time Management', 'Habits', 'Productivity']
Title: Spend Time Disconnected Content: We are spending more and more of our time plugged in.

Title: Clear your countertop & desk Content: Get rid of trinkets and clear it up before heading to bed.Make sure to keep your desk clear at work if you can. Fewer distractions mean fewer things to think about.ㅇ['Productivity', 'Health', 'Personal Development', 'Time Management']
Title: Slow down and breath Content: Be conscious of your surroundings and enjoy the moment. Get out of the office at work, go for a stroll, read a book in a coffee shop for 20 mins. When things get on top of you concentrate on your breathing, this will focus your mind and calm you.ㅇ['Productivity', 'Health', 'Personal Development', 'Time Management']
Title: Motivated perception Content: It is the idea that we see what we want to see.It’s similar to another concept — motivated reasoning, where we come to conclusions we’re predisposed to believe in.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Psychology', 'Health']
Title: Deal in facts Content: Objectivity is crucial to constructive criticism.The goal is to communicate that a performance standard has not been met. Your sentiments/judgments are irrelevant.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Career']
Title: Show them the way Content: Criticism without an action plan is worthless.Give people direction or keep your mouth shut.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Career']
Title: Playing by your rules Content: If you believe that playing by your own rules is a good philosophy for your life, then it’s important to believe the same applies to others.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Habits']
Title: Clear some space Content: This could be your mental, emotional or physical space or all three.Clearing space provides peace and calmness. It also clears away the “clutter” that has been inhibiting and holding back your life. In their place, what gives you joy, growth and value will have the space to enter and flourish. Take it one step at a time but start with something.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Habits', 'Money & Investments']
Title: Your Debt Content: If debt is holding you captive, reduce it. Start today. Do what you’ve got to do to get out from under its weight. Find the help that you need. Sacrifice luxurytoday to enjoy freedom tomorrow.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Habits', 'Time Management', 'Productivity']
Title: Get Some Exercise Content: Exercise makes you healthier, so be sure to get some exercise every day.You don’t need to spend hours at the gym to get the benefit of this; take a walk around the block, or do some isometrics at your desk.ㅇ['Habits', 'Personal Development', 'Time Management', 'Productivity']
Title: Use the Pomodoro Technique Content: This productivity technique combines single-tasking with a built-in reward system.Set an alarm for 25 minutes and work on a specific task without stopping. When the timer rings, reward yourself with a 5-minute break, then restart the cycle. After repeating the cycle a few times, give yourself a satisfying 30-minute break.ㅇ['Time Management', 'Productivity', 'Personal Development', 'Entrepreneurship']
Title: Start Each Day With a Win Content: There’s nothing more satisfying than crossing an item off your to-do list early in the day.Start each day by accomplishing an easy but necessary task, like finishing a reading assignment or returning a phone call.ㅇ['Time Management', 'Productivity', 'Personal Development', 'Entrepreneurship']
Title: Focus Only on the Next Action Content: When you have a multi-action task, keep only its next sequential action on your to-do list. When the task is complete, refer to your project list and add its next action to your to-do list. At any given moment, your to-do list should contain only the next logical action for all your working projects. That's it - just one bite-sized step in each undertaking.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Time Management', 'Productivity']
Title: Keep Your List Short Content: Just as no one wants to look at an email inbox with 2,386 messages in it, no one wants to have an endless to-do list. It's overwhelming and depressing.Instead, keep your to-do list under 20 items. Your to-do list should be short, to-the-point commitments that involve no more deciding as to whether you're actually serious about doing them.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Time Management', 'Productivity']
Title: Keep Your List Moving Content: Although my to-do list is only 20 items or so, it's 20 items that change every day. Every day, two to five tasks get checked off, and two to five tasks get added.Your to-do list is a working document.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Time Management', 'Productivity']
"Title: Eliminate interruptions Content: Dustin Moskovitz, CEO ofAsana (productivity and project management platform):""We practice “No Meeting Wednesdays” to ensure that everyone at the company gets a large block of time to focus on heads-down work without having to fit it in between meetings. This may be our most valuable cultural practice, and I encourage every company to consider adopting it.Additionally, we reflect frequently on whether our group activities are getting enough ROI to justify the interrupt and time expenditure. """ㅇ['Time Management', 'Productivity', 'Personal Development', 'Teamwork', 'Remote Work']
Title: Sharpen your focus Content: Time boxing a particular task helps with excluding other tasks and unrelated thoughts from your radar during that particular time window.Reducing mental clutter is essential if you want to be fully productive.ㅇ['Time Management', 'Productivity', 'Personal Development', 'Problem Solving']
Title: Create a work rhythm Content: You only get maximum effectiveness if you properly balance periods of work and rest. Time boxes provide a great framework to allow this balance to happen. The key is to find your own rhythm.Alternating between different types of time boxes (such as work/rest, or hard/easy tasks) maximizes your use of energy and enables you to accomplish much more.ㅇ['Time Management', 'Productivity', 'Personal Development', 'Problem Solving']
Title: What Zen Is Not Content: A habitSimplicityA state of peaceA state of mindA minimalist aestheticLiving simplyA destinationJust being in the momentㅇ['Mindfulness', 'Meditation', 'Philosophy']
Title: Tell the Truth Content: In general, facts matter less than emotions when trying to persuade someone. People choose to believeinformation that matches what they already believe and avoid facts that might contradict them.But they will get angry if you mislead them. And you will lose their trust. Accuracy matters. Make sure what you say rings true.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Reading & Writing', 'Problem Solving']
Title: Journaling to have a proof of progress Content: When you have a bad day, it can be easy to forget how much progress you have made. But with a journal, it's easier to keep a sense of perspective. One glance at your previous entries and you have proof of how much you have grown over the months and years.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Reading & Writing', 'Problem Solving', 'Mindfulness']
Title: Living in the moment Content: When we write we focus on the details. We write about the little details of an interaction with someone. And most times when journaling we write while the interaction is still fresh in our minds.This strengthens our observation muscle. Then we start looking for little details in our next interaction.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Habits', 'Communication', 'Reading & Writing']
Title: Journaling helps us reflect Content: Journaling increases self-awareness. Recording your thoughts is like stepping in wet concrete. The outline of your foot is now there forever.You can find out who you really are. You can find your weaknesses and new opportunities. You can challenge yourself with those realizations. You can make plans to better yourself.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Habits', 'Communication', 'Reading & Writing']
Title: Schedule journaling time Content: Start your daily journal off on the right foot by scheduling your writing for a set time every day.If you find your mind is most active in the morning, wake up 15 to 20 minutes earlier and jot down your thoughts then. If you prefer to record everything after the day is over, then make it an evening activity before you go to bed.ㅇ['Reading & Writing', 'Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Mindfulness']
Title: The right journaling tools Content: There is a traditional way of journaling with a notebook and a pen or pencil. Then there’s the modern method, where you type your thoughts on a device.Choose a method that you can do consistently.ㅇ['Reading & Writing', 'Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Mindfulness']
Title: Date each journal entry Content: When it comes to your journal entries, if it’s important enough to record, then it’s important enough to date.Having a date above each entry can help you understand your thought process as it relates to important life events.ㅇ['Reading & Writing', 'Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Mindfulness']
Title: Honesty and journaling Content: Record how you really feel, not how you think you should feel.  Share the first thought that comes to mind. The first thing you think about is typically what’s most important to you at that moment.ㅇ['Reading & Writing', 'Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Mindfulness']
Title: Journaling: An effective tool Content: Journaling can be used to sort through turbulent emotions and to discover hidden lessons from your experience.Art journaling: using mixed media can help you express yourself in refreshing and unusual ways.Journals can help you reflect. Journaling is a method of allowing the light of understanding and compassion to shine on your past.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Reading & Writing', 'Communication', 'Problem Solving']
Title: Don’t Use Full Sentences Content: Feel free to have your journal as disjointed as you want. Leo Babatua of ZenHabits says he only writes his journal in bullet points; just three to six per day. By making it this easy, he says it’s much more attainable for him to keep it up.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Reading & Writing', 'Mindfulness', 'Time Management', 'Habits']
Title: When we question our thinking Content: People became philosophers when they began to question what guides their thinking and analyze their thoughts.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Philosophy', 'Communication']
Title: All-or-nothing thinking Content: Today, one of the most common destructive thought patterns is all-or-nothing thinking. In other words, perfectionism.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Philosophy', 'Communication']
Title: Perfection is unrealistic Content: Whomever we get together with will be radically imperfect in a host of deeply serious ways.We must kill the idea that things would be ideal with any other creature in this galaxy. There can only ever be a “good enough” relationship.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development']
Title: Relationships require administration Content: What a couple gets up to over a lifetime has much more in common with the workings of a small business. They must draw up work rosters, clean, cook, fix, throw away, mind, hire, fire, reconcile and budget.None of these activities have a glamourous halo. And yet these tasks are what is truly “romantic” in the sense of “conducive and sustaining of love” and should be interpreted as the bedrock of a successful relationship.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development']
Title: Sex and love Content: The general view expects that love and sex will be aligned. But in truth, they won’t stay so beyond a few months or, at best, one or two years. This is not anyone’s fault. Relationships in the long term have other key concerns (companionship, administration, another generation).ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development']
Title: Fiction has ruined love Content: Fiction is where we learn about love, about having a crush on someone; about the magical moment that one’s eyes meet another’s across a room and how that leads to happily ever after.But, love isn’t an indescribable feeling – it’s a skill – and one that we have to work on.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology']
Title: ‘How I’m crazy’ instruction manual Content: Thinking we’re easy to live with is an easy mistake to make.We’re all broken in some way. We lack self-awareness about the many ways in which we are uniquely mad. Alain de Botton believes we should be swapping instruction manuals on the first date.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology']
Title: We hope too much Content: Children who grow up in the company of difficult adults settle on doing one thing extremely well: hoping against hope that these adults will magically change and learn to be kind.This kind of 'patience' is then transferred into their adult relationships, with similarly negligible results.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Psychology', 'Mental Health']
Title: Validate your emotions Content: Label the emotion. When you notice yourself feeling badly emotionally, simply describe what the emotion is that you’re feeling (sad, anxious, frustrated, etc.).Acknowledge the discomfort.Acknowledge that it’s okay to feel that way even emotionally if it feels uncomfortable or painful.Accept the emotion. Accept that the emotion is with you and that you can still proceed with life despite having that emotion.ㅇ['Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Mental Health', 'Problem Solving']
Title: Instinctual Versus Intentional Behavior Content: Western philosophical traditions tend to distrust spontaneity since it supposedly clears the way for the dominance of brute animal instincts and dangerous passions.Conversely, Zen thinkers believe that intuition, in a healthy soul, is more important than conscious reflection and that evolution has made the human unconscious wise, not reckless.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Philosophy', 'Mindfulness']
Title: Alan Watts’ Take On Buddhism Content: Life has no intrinsic meaning but that which we give it.Everything is uncertain, so we must put together a world view that fits roughly with the facts, and accept that it is just a guess. Life cannot be described, only experienced. Zazen, spending hours seated in contemplative meditation, is unnecessary.Karma and reincarnation are not real.Zen and Taoism are more like psychotherapy than religion. They offer ways to maintain a healthy personality in a contradictory and repressive culture. Zen philosophy teaches one to think clearly, and thus transcend conventional thinking to a place where the mind could be at peace despite its environment.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Philosophy', 'Mindfulness']
Title: Get to the point Content: Our attention span is only decreasing as time goes on and so those who can get to the point will win in this new attention economy.Your advice may be amazing, but it will never be heard if you can’t get to the point.ㅇ['Communication', 'Career']
Title: Hunger Content: Chronic hunger generally indicates that your diet is imbalanced or inadequate, which can cause your body to conserve energy and resist weight loss.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Exercise & Fitnesss']
"Title: Cravings Content: Trying to be ""perfect"" week after week typically leads to feelings of deprivation, resentment, even anger or depression, and culminates in either binge eating, or diet abandonment.Ditch the ""all or nothing"" mentality. In that mindset, one small diet deviation triggers thoughts like, ""Well, I blew it, I might as well go all out!"" which keeps you stuck. Allow yourself small splurges in ways that reduce the chance of overeating."ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Exercise & Fitnesss']
Title: Maintaining weight loss Content: The actual food you eat isn’t the main thing that enables you to keep weight off.Maintaining a weight-reduced state is a lifelong journey andmany dietary approaches can work to facilitate weight loss and keep it off.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Exercise & Fitnesss']
Title: Poor Timing of Meals Content: Irregular eating schedules have subtle, yet traceable negative health effects and are associated with increased risks of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and inflammation.Simply by staying in sync with your circadian rhythm will facilitate weight loss. Try eating breakfast every day within one hour of waking up, then having a healthy snack or meal every three to four hours.ㅇ['Health', 'Personal Development', 'Mental Health', 'Mindfulness', 'Psychology']
Title: The Persona Content: In a public situation, we present a different version of ourselves than from the one at home. Every profession has unspoken agreements about which manners are acceptable, and which are not. It is then the purpose of the persona to suppress the impulses and emotions that are not considered socially acceptable. The difficulty is when one becomes so identified with his persona that he loses all sense of self. The result is an inflated persona with excessive concern for what people think and a lack of courage to endure conflict and refuse others' wishes.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Communication']
Title: The Shadow Content: The 'shadow self' is everything a person has denied in themselves, such as spontaneity, aggression, cowardice, carelessness, passion, enthusiasm. It embraces all the thoughts and moods for which we feel guilt and shame.The shadow is emotional, for it must oppose the rigidness of the ego. It is prone to psychological projection, where we attribute to others the inferior qualities we do not want to admit are in ourselves. When we perceive a moral deficiency in others, we can be sure there is similar inferiority within ourselves.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Communication']
Title: Lack of Clear Goals Content: Vague goals can scupper your motivation and progress, so too can the lack of clear and precise goals.Draw up a plan of where you want to go, and how you are going to get there step by step.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Personal Development', 'Exercise & Fitnesss']
Title: Crash Dieting Content: It reflects our desire for instant gratification and the all too human reluctance to be patient.Drastically reduced calorific intake shunts the body into 'starvation mode'. This effectively slows down metabolism and causes you to convert almost everything that you consume into energy-storing fat cells in case you encounter “famine” conditions again, and your body needs something to feed off.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Personal Development', 'Exercise & Fitnesss']
Title: Ignoring Exercise Content: The majority of the calories you burn each day are determined by your resting metabolic rate (RMR).RMR is largely a function of how much muscle you have on your frame, and how hard that muscle is made to work. Therefore adding activities that promote or maintain muscle mass will make your body work harder and elevate your metabolism. Weight training is the single best form of exercise for achieving these goals.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Personal Development', 'Exercise & Fitnesss']
Title: How to stick to a diet Content: Make small but sustainable changes, stay away from anything extreme, and build up small changes over time.Most people would rather have a horrible 10 days of a raw, low-carb, no salt, no sugar, no water diet and return to their old habits than really have to address that $150 Frappuccino bill they're racking up each month.ㅇ['Food', 'Health']
Title: Immediate Payoff Content: When we learn to delay the gratification that we seek instantly, we see a macro view of our life and can visualize where we stand, and where we want to be. Our brain will continuously sabotage our efforts, but if we push past the resistance intentionally, we find that it was just a paper wall, which we can easily overcome.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Time Management', 'Productivity', 'Habits']
Title: Just Get Started Content: According to author James Clear, getting started reduces the friction and sets you up for further accomplishments. Without worrying about results, we simply need to focus on making a regular effort and getting started on it no matter what.Example: Not exercising is less likely once we are at the gym, but is more likely if we are still in bed.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Time Management', 'Productivity', 'Habits']

Title: Bach: The Music Of Harmony Content: For many musicians, Bach is the ‘alpha’, a shared point of reference, a starting language of how music can be made, and how it can sound. His work is timeless and covered by countless composers, jazz players and patrons. In his instrumental works, his music had a sense of balance and harmony which is found in nature, in the trees, the moon and the sky.Pieces like the Six Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin and The Well-Tempered Clavier provide a glimpse of the other shore of the universe. The works are precise, complete, and mathematically balanced. They feel satisfying after hundreds of years as they carry a theme where each repetition and transformation fits like a jigsaw puzzle. This was never repeated or fully emulated by any other musician ever since.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Music', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture']
Title: News consumption Content: Abstaining from all news would probably look like you're about to betray your civic duty, but watching every story in real-time is a betrayal of your sanity.Consider checking in on the news once a day for 45 minutes, preferably in the morning.

Title: Not Setting Personal Goals Content: Goals give you a destination and a vision to work toward.

It should be a reflex, a default.Money: Reading is not a luxury.

Title: Write A Stop-Doing List Content: Remind yourself of items that don’t bring you joy, and contribute very little to your long-term goals.This way, you’re unlikely to spend a lot of time doing time-sucking, non-rewarding work, freeing you up to do the work that does make you happy in the long run.ㅇ['Time Management', 'Productivity', 'Personal Development', 'Problem Solving']
Title: Focusing On One Task At A Time Content: Think about how many times you wasted time worrying about something that’s completely unrelated to what you’re working on.A wandering mind is not always a happy mind. The ability to think about what is not happening is a cognitive achievement that comes at an emotional cost.ㅇ['Time Management', 'Productivity', 'Personal Development', 'Problem Solving']
Title: Writing And Priorities Content: If you feel too overwhelmed for writing, list your goals in order of importance. Maybe writing is not your top goal and you are wasting energy thinking you should do it because you haven’t realized it.If writing is near the top of your list, you need to decide what else can be let go.

Title: A Consistent Organizational System Content: It is an external strategy for keeping track of what we need to do and accomplish. By creating and maintaining a reliable organizational system, we give ourselves the best possible chance of efficiently processing the day-to-day Have-Tos, so that we have sufficient time and energy to focus on the Want-Tos (the things that really matter to us).ㅇ['Health', 'Personal Development', 'Habits', 'Mental Health', 'Mindfulness']
Title: A one size fits all solution Content: Instead of relying on a tool with all the bells and whistles, find out where you’re struggling and what’s essential for you.For example, if scheduling is taking you away from product development, then you could use a scheduling tool that uses machine learning to automate most of your scheduling needs. If you’re wasting too much time on email, then consider using a tool to help tame your inbox.ㅇ['Time Management', 'Productivity', 'Personal Development']
Title: Never waste your time Content: It’s okay to waste time now and then. That doesn’t mean binge-watching Netflix.Instead of working all day -- take some time to read, listen to a podcast, exercise, or catch-up with an old friend or colleague.

Title: Not planning ahead Content: If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.A lot of people wake up late on the weekend.

Title: An Overwhelmed Team Content: While a manager expects and assumes the team to be top-notch in their work, completing projects like there is no tomorrow, the reality of workers is quite different. More than half of the workforce is overwhelmed and maxed-out, according to a survey.A manager cannot pretend everything is hunky-dory and has to recognize the problem and provide solutions.ㅇ['Teamwork', 'Career', 'Personal Development', 'Remote Work', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Signs Of An Overwhelmed Team Content: Dip in energy levels: It happens when the team is not enthusiastic and is only taking reactive actions and going through the motion, exposing the mental pressure they are in.Work quality is taking a dip: It happens if you see incomplete or sloppy work, along with decreased productivity.Frayed emotions: If workers are terse and curt with their colleagues in their personal interaction and written correspondence.Other unexpected irregularities: There may be some that move inside their mental ‘cave’ and others who become overtly extrovert.ㅇ['Teamwork', 'Career', 'Personal Development', 'Remote Work', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Replan And Rebalance Content: If there are signs of team overwhelm, the manager needs to first see if the work can be shared with others, or if any deadline can be extended, providing some relief to the workers.

Title: Communicate Content: Your partner is not a mind reader.Share your thoughts.

Most problems, big and small, within a relationship, start with bad communication.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Personal Development', 'Communication']
Title: Negotiate and compromise Content: Since people’s needs change over time, and life itself demands change too, the inner workings of good relationships are negotiated and re-negotiated all the time.And oftentimes a two-way compromise is the best solution.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Personal Development', 'Communication']

Title: Cultivate common interests Content: Don’t minimize the importance of activities you can do together that you both enjoy.

Title: Put wins and setbacks on the calendar Content: ... and celebrate them every few weeks. The maximum time between these retrospectives should be three weeks. Any longer and people will start to forget the realities of the situation. Newer teams that are still finding their groove should schedule more frequent meetings.ㅇ['Teamwork', 'Corporate Culture', 'Personal Development', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Give your team autonomy Content: When you celebrate wins and failures, your team should walk away with an actionable plan to change things moving forward.  Teams want to be left alone to do the work and be trusted that they can do it.

Title: Imagine Your Desired Future Self Content: Using deliberate practice, imagine a clear goal of what you want to achieve in the future and work towards it by reverse-engineering the process. Having a ‘flagpole’ in the future that you can see clearly can get you there fast.Even our main drivers, motivation and hope, come into formation when a clear picture is visible to us about the desired outcome.Using ‘prospection’, we need to believe we can create a clear and exciting future, and what we do today affects it directly.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Psychology', 'Problem Solving']

"Title: The flow state Content: We experience the ""flow state"" when a given task becomes effortless and time slips by without our noticing. It's an absorbing, intrinsically rewarding state that we enter when performing certain tasks.When in the flow state we experience mindfulness and actions and awareness merge, so that it seems like the task is almost performing itself. Despite this, there's still a sense of personal control over the task at hand, and performing it feels intrinsically rewarding."ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Time Management', 'Productivity', 'Problem Solving']
Title: To enter the flow state... Content: The activity must have a clear set of goals and progress, which adds direction and structure to the task.The task must have clear and immediate feedback, which enables the person to adjust while performing the task.There must be a good balance between the perceived challenge of the task and the individual's own perceived skills.

Title: The Curse Of Knowledge Content: The Curse Of Knowledge is common among many experts, teachers and professionals, and is a cognitive bias where the knowledgeable person incorrectly assumes that others are able to decipher what he is trying to say.This has serious implications in the field of education and sales when the better-informed speaker is unable to adjust their content and words to the level of the audience or prospect.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Learning & Education']
Title: The Goldilocks Principle Content: Just like the fairy tale of Goldilocks and the Three Bears, where the preferred porridge has to be neither too hot nor too cold, and the preferred bed has to be neither too soft nor too hard, we have to find our sweet spot which has the right amount of stress, anxiety, challenge and thrill, while not being paralyzing or life-sucking.Demanding jobs carry with them worry, stress and anxiety, but not having anything to worry about in a job is also detrimental to our well-being.ㅇ['Health', 'Personal Development', 'Mental Health', 'Psychology', 'Money & Investments']

The process highlights, rather than conceals, the cracks, allowing them to become a part of the piece, too. When his daughter accidentally broke some of his work, Hamana said, laughing, he decided to leave the pieces outside for a few years, allowing them to be coloured and shaped by nature. When it was repaired by a local kintsugi specialist, the different colours created a contrast so subtle, so uneven, that could never have been intentionally created. Embracing the effects of nature and allowing family history to be visible in a piece creates a unique value for something which would, in many cultures, simply be discarded as worthless.ㅇ['Religion & Spirituality', 'History', 'Travel', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture']
Title: The invention of scotch tape Content: Richard Drew invented The Scotch transparent tape while working as a lab tech at the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, which was then manufacturing sandpaper.Drew first invented masking tape. Drew would deliver sandpaper samples to auto manufacturers, who used it for the painting process. Workers needed to mask off part of the car, often using glued-on newspaper or butcher paper. But it was difficult to get off and often resulted in a sticky mess.Drew promised a solution. He spent two years developing a tape until the company executive told him to get back to his regular job.

Title: My Red Is Your Blue Content: About 1 per cent of American men suffer from red-green colour blindness. Recent experiments challenge the accepted notion that all of us have the same default perception of the colours we see.

Title: Capitalist vs. Socialist Economies: An Overview Content: Capitalism and socialism are economic systems that countries use to manage their economic resources and regulate their means of production.In the United States, capitalism has always been the prevailing system. It is defined as an economic system where private individuals or businesses, rather than the government, own and control the factors of production: entrepreneurship, capital goods, natural resources and labor. Capitalism's success is dependent on a free market economy, driven by supply and demand.With socialism, all legal production and distribution decisions are made by the government, with individuals dependent on the state for food, employment, healthcare and everything else. The government, rather than the free market, determines the amount of output, or supply and the pricing levels of these goods and services.Communist countries, like China, North Korea, and Cuba, tend toward socialism, while Western European countries favor capitalist economies and try to chart a middle course.

People will want to be with you when you are happy with yourself.Admit your mistakeDon’t break eye contact even after he or she has finished speaking.People like to feel heard, and being an active listener can make a positive impression. ""Do this by staying engaged instead of focusing on what you’ll say next,""Energy is contagious. When we smile and are upbeat, it can make us more attractive. It also tends to trickle into others. Our vibe attracts our tribe.Whether it’s easy or not, being honest with others is a sure-fire way to gain their trust as well as their respect.If you a woman, a man will like you if you can make him feel masculine. No instructions, no advice and give him ample space.Generally, accepting others as he is, makes you most likable.When a person can be his own self in your company without being judged, he loves you more.Do not brag about your successes. Nobody likes a show-off.Be humble.Offer them food.When with a group of people, including everyone in the conversation. Never leave anybody out."ㅇ[]

Title: Evaporative cooling Content: 1720s. Scottish doctor William Cullen saw that evaporation had a cooling effect. 1748. Cullen demonstrated his ideas by evaporating ethyl ether in a vacuum. 1805. Oliver Evans designed a refrigeration machine that used vapor instead of liquid.1820. English scientist Micahel Faraday used liquefied ammonia for cooling. 1835. Jacob Perkins, who worked with Evans, patented a vapor-compression cycle using liquid ammonia.1842. John Gorrie, an American doctor, built a machine similar to Evans's design to artificially create ice and cool down patients with yellow fever.New and improved refrigeration ideas continued to be developed, including Albert Einstein's idea of an environmentally friendly refrigerator with no moving parts that did not rely on electricity.By 1920, refrigerators were considered essential in American homes.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Personal Development', 'Technology & The Future']
Title: How refrigerators work Content: Refrigerators today work by evaporating liquids.The liquids are pushed through the refrigerator through tubes and begin to vaporize. As the liquids evaporate, they carry heat away with them as the gases travel to a coil outside the refrigerator. Here the heat is released. The gases return to a compressor, where they become liquid again, restarting the cycle.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Personal Development', 'Technology & The Future']
Title: Light And Dark Triads Content: Our personalities have two distinct triads: The Light Triad and The Dark Triad. The dark ones sometimes overlap with the light ones to form a complete personality.The Dark Triad, which is associated with the Seven Deadly Sins (Lust, Anger, Greed, Sloth, Gluttony, Pride and Envy) seems to be very fascinating, with many researchers drawn towards it just like viewers are drawn to serial-killer shows and murder mysteries.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Problem Solving', 'Communication', 'Religion & Spirituality']
Title: Personality Triads: Research Results Content: Some findings from the extensive research:A sizable number of people on the Light Triad were older and mature, with more females.A study on the behaviour of United States Senators showed many exhibiting the Dark Triad.People tend to slightly tilt towards goodness and are basically nice if their defence mechanism is not activated.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Problem Solving', 'Communication', 'Religion & Spirituality']

Title: How to be social Content: Growing up, I was one of the shyest and most socially awkward people you’d ever meet.I didn’t know how to hold eye contact.I didn’t know how to hold a conversation.And I sure as heck didn’t know how to get a beautiful woman to go on a date with me.… Today it’s a slightly different story.Today, I get to party with multimillionaires and celebrities like Ashton Kutcher, Lance Armstrong, Naveen Jain (billionaire founder of Moon Express), and even Matthew McConaughey (alright, alright, alright).I don’t say this to brag.But rather to impress upon you that the tactics I’m about to share WORK.Being charismatic and socially adept is not a skill you are born with.…It’s not genetic.It’s not something you are cursed with.It’s a skill…And if you’re willing to take the time to develop it, it’s a skill that can (and will) change your life in every appreciable way.Here are a few tips to improve your social skills and become a social powerhouse.1. Speak Less, Listen MoreThis is the golden rule of social success.People don’t really care about you… This might sound harsh, but it’s true.People care, first and foremost, about themselves. This is simply human nature.If you want to unlock the hidden social genius that is inside of you, then you need to accept this fact and use it to your advantage.In any social situation, your goal should always be to do about 20% of the talking and 80% of the listening.Ask people genuine questions. Get to know them. Be genuinely curious about who they are and how they work.Sure…You can talk about yourself and share stories from your life, but this should only account for 20–30% of any given interaction.Instead, spend the majority of your time focused on the other person and I promise you will seem like the most likeable and charismatic person in the room.If you’re ever at a loss for words, remember this magic phrase…“So you said …Tell me moreabout that”2. Learn How to Tell a JokePeople love to laugh.If you can learn how to make them laugh you will instantly boost your social value and increase your likeability.The best way that I’ve found to improve your sense of humor and tell better jokes is to watch hours and hours of stand up comedy.Guys and gals likeJoe RoganAri SchaffirJohn MullaneyEliza Schlesinger (or however you spell it)Sarah SilvermanWhitney CummingsChris RockDave ChapelleAre all hilarious individuals who will help you develop a vast repertoire of comedic material and learn how to tell and deliver a joke like a pro.3. Enthusiasm Always WinsIn any social situation, the most enthusiastic person always wins.Before you go into any social situation, I recommend that you take 10 minutes to get “In State” by listening to a song that motivates you and pumps you up and dance/jump around the room.This sounds silly but it will help you develop the right energy to succeed in a social setting.Enthusiasm is contagious.When someone is excited and brings high levels of energy to the table, even the most mundane task can become an absolute joy.Enthusiasm always wins.So get some… Enthusiasm that is.4. SmileA smile goes a long way.Scientists have foundthat people who smile more are more attractive, healthier,and more likely to have strong social connections.So smile more.Watch lots of comedies.Listen to funny podcasts.Hang out with people who make you smile.The more you smile the happier you will be and the more attractive you will appear.So turn that frown upside down and smile baby smile!5. Hold Eye Contact (But Don’t Be Creepy)Eye contact is an important part of social success, but it’s easy to overdo it.I recommend that you hold eye contact for 4–5 seconds before slowly breaking it away and then reengaging a few seconds later.Whenever you are holding eye contact it can be easier to look at a person’s mouth, nose, or forehead since they can’t actually tell the difference.Strong eye contact is a sign of confidence and it makes people take you more seriously and listen to what you have to say.It’s also incredibly seductive.A man or woman who can hold great eye contact is a man or woman who is attractive to the opposite (or same) sex.6. Speak Your TruthOne of the sexiest things that you can do in any social situation is to speak your truth.This doesn’t mean that you have a hall pass to simply be a jerk and berate people.It simply means that you can and should express your feelings in an appropriate way.If you want to do something, say it.If someone said something that was inappropriate and offensive to your group, call them out on it.If you think someone is cute, express it.If someone is getting on your last nerve, mention it.Don’t hide behind dishonesty and half truths.Speak your truth and say what you mean.People won’t always like it, but the right people will always respect it.7. Use People’s NamesYour name is one of the most powerful words in your entire vocabulary.In fact, researchers have found that when you hear your name a completely different part of your brain activates than when you hear any other word.Use this to your advantage.Always try to use people’s names in conversation.Drop their names casually and regularly without overdoing it.This is a simple subconscious hack that will make others like you more and make you seem more attractive.8. Make Other People Look GoodThe biggest social hack that I know of is to make other people look good.People love to talk about themselves.But do you know what they like even more?… When other people talk about them in a positive way.Anytime you are out with friends, always try to tell stories and jokes that make the other people in your social circle look good.Tell stories about times when your friends did something crazy, cool, or impressive.Go out of your way to make the people in your social circle feel special and it will pay dividends in your social success.9. Give Genuine ComplimentsFor whatever reason, our society seems to have lost the ability to give a genuine compliment.Men are scared that if they compliment a woman they will seem creepy or if they compliment another man they will seem “Gay” (not that this should be considered an insult but that’s just how society is).But this is all bull crap!When you genuinely compliment someone, they will appreciate it.If they don’t…Well, they probably weren’t worth having in your social circle in the first place.Give genuine compliments on a regular basis and I promise you will see a massive increase in your social capital and charisma.10. Present Yourself WellWhile I wish I could tell you that looks don’t matter.…I’d be lying to you.How you present yourself to the world MATTERS.People make split second judgement based on your appearance and, even though this might not be fair, it’s the reality that we live in.As such, it’s important that you:Practice good hygieneSmell greatDress appropriately with clothes that fit your bodyWhiten your teethGet a good tanExercise regularlyAnd look the partYou don’t have to be traditionally beautiful to be a social powerhouse.But youdoneed to put some effort into putting your best foot forward and presenting yourself well.Stay Grounded,Andrewㅇ[]

Title: How to reach weight-loss goals Content: Finding a weight-loss diet is usually not a problem, be it paleo, low-carb, or wine-based. The real challenge is sticking to it. A recent study used data from a diet app and concluded that small, short-term goals that responded to the dieter's progress helped them reach their long-term goals.Despite the goals being self-directed, people take their daily goals seriously. Even if there is no kind of punishment attached, they will reduce their consumption or increase their exercise to keep them near their goals. Those who achieved their short-term goals were more likely to meet subsequent goals.ㅇ['Health', 'Personal Development', 'Food', 'Time Management']

Title: The placebo effect Content: The placebo effect happens when a person takes medication that he thinks will help, but the medication has not been proven to be effective for the specific condition. Placebos work in about 30 percent of patients. Some placebos contain no active ingredient. Other placebos do have active ingredients but aren't proven to work on the patient's particular condition. There are even placebos in the form of surgery, injections, and other types of medical therapies.ㅇ['Health', 'Psychology', 'Money & Investments', 'Science & Nature']
"Title: The placebo prescribing controversy Content: The American Medical Association created a policy concerning placebos that states that ""physicians may use placebos for diagnosis or treatment only if the patient is informed of and agrees to its use.""Generally, doctors who prescribe placebos say that they have something they believe may help, but they don't know exactly how it will work. They don't believe they are lying to the patient, because the patient could still benefit from the placebo effect.Another problem in prescribing placebos is that they have been shown to only work on half the population. The placebo effect is also short-term - it doesn't work for chronic conditions.Prescribing drugs such as sedatives and antibiotics as placebos could do more harm than good. Many sedatives are habit-forming, and prescribing antibiotics may contribute to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria."ㅇ['Health', 'Psychology', 'Money & Investments', 'Science & Nature']

Title: Choose growth over happiness Content: Major personal decisions should be made not by asking if it will make you happy, but if this choice will enlarge or diminish you.We are not good at predicting what will make us happy - it makes us concentrate on our narrow preferences for security and control. Focusing on enlargement questions draws out a more in-depth, intuitive response. You tend to know whether choosing to do something may bring short-term comfort that would prevent growth.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Mental Health', 'Time Management']
Title: The advice you avoid is the advice you need Content: It's not comfortable to confront emotional experiences you're trying to avoid.However, doing so is what you need.

Title: The future will never be certain Content: Much of our troubles arise from trying to control what is not in our control - such as the future. We want to know that things will work out later on. But we never can.It's liberating to understand that no amount of worry will ever change this truth. A plan is only a statement of intent, not a guarantee that the future will obey your plan. This means not living each day, bracing yourself to see if things will work out as you desired.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Mental Health', 'Time Management']

Title: Why we crave food Content: Food cravings occur in the same regions in the brain as memory, pleasure, and reward. Physical hunger develops over time, and you will desire a variety of different foods. Emotional hunger comes on suddenly and is usually for a specific food that makes you feel good while eating it.Emotional eating can turn into a bad habit. Food provides satisfaction. When you experience satisfaction, your brain is flooded with dopamine, which motivates you to keep eating to feel good.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Personal Development']
Title: Having Power: Bringing A Different Perspective To The Table Content: Historically, power was mostly about controlling access to information. However, the internet has leveled that field. A Google search result can show you the same thing as a CEO. Credentials are devaluing. MIT, Stanford, and other universities share many of their classes online for free.That means your advantage lies in looking at the same reality but seeing something different. This is done by using the two components of your mental latticework: having mental models from multiple disciplines and using them in a very routine way.ㅇ[]
Title: The Napoleon technique Content: This is a productivity technique that involves delaying dealing with something when there is a good chance that it will resolve without your immediate input.When Napoleon was a general in Italy, he directed Bourrienne to only open letters that came by extraordinary couriers, and to leave all the other letters unopened for three weeks. He observed that a large part of the correspondence had disposed of itself and no longer required an answer.The Napoleon technique's main benefit is that it allows you to conserve resources such as time and energy.

Title: How emotional decision-making works Content: Thinking in a rational manner is more effective when there are limited pieces of information.However, those focused on feelings prove far better incomplex conditions.The advantages of emotional decision-making could be undone by a subsequent bout of deliberation, which suggests that we shouldn't doubt a particularly strong instinct, at least when considering lots of information.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Health', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: The Ideal Decision-Making Process Content: Free discussion: all viewpoints and different aspects of an issue are openly debated andwhereeveryone has a chance to speak or express their opinions.Reaching a clear decision.

This does not necessarily mean agreement: so long as the participants commit to back the decision, that is a satisfactory outcome.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Corporate Culture', 'Psychology', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: The Peer-Group Syndrome Content: Peers tend to look for a more senior manager, even if he is not the most competent or knowledgeable person involved, to take over because they are afraid to stick their necks out.You can overcome the peer-group syndrome by fostering self-confidence, which stems from being familiar with the issue under consideration, experience and the realization that nobody has ever died from making a wrong business decision.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Corporate Culture', 'Psychology', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Don’t Lie About Yourself Content: Men are most likely to lie about their occupations on dating apps, whereas women tend to use old pictures or heavily edited recent ones.Most lies people tell on dating apps aim to portray them in a way they think the other person will deem attractive.

In these instances, it is always better to be safe than sorry.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Psychology']
Title: Mental Toughness Requires Habits Content: ... not motivation. Motivation comes and goes. Mental toughness is about building the daily habits that allow you to stick to a schedule and overcome challenges and distractions consistently.Mentally tough people don’t need to have more courage, talent or intelligence — just more consistency.

Title: Oreo was not an original concept Content: Food scientist Sam J. Porcello invented the newer version of the Oreo. He was one of the world's foremost experts on cocoa and helped develop the extra indulgent chocolate and white chocolate-covered Oreo.The original recipe for Oreo cookies contained lard (pork fat). With the changing climate of the low-fat 1990s, the lard was replaced, and the cookie became kosher and unexpectedly also vegan.ㅇ['Health', 'Personal Development', 'Food', 'Money & Investments', 'Marketing & Sales']

You want these to showcase your best style as you either wear them very often (e. G. Work clothes, coats) or only on special occasions (e. G. Wedding outfits).On the other hand, seasonal items (e. G. Winter hats or swimsuits) and trendy pieces (e. G. Loud prints or neons) are short term investments that should be cycled out.

Title: Why People Sleepwalk Content: People used to think that sleepwalkers acted out their dreams. However, sleepwalking occurs during the deepest stages of sleep when you are not dreaming. Mental health professionals state that sleepwalking is an arousal disorder, meaning that something triggers the brain, so the person is in a transition state between sleeping and waking.Most sleepwalkers are children. It could be because their brains outpace others in development or that a child's brain is too immature to understand waking and sleeping cycles.Children tend to sleepwalk more when they are overly tired or stressed. The same factors affect adult sleepwalkers, as well as medicines, alcohol, and fever illnesses.Sleepwalking has been linked to seizures, REM sleep disorders, and brain disorders like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.ㅇ['Health']

This relationship ignores logic - it’s the person who you know is bad for you but you just can’t stop seeing.The sweet spot is a relationship with both compatibility and chemistry.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Psychology']
Title: Save For Staple Items Content: Quality apparel has a higher price than fast fashion clothing because they use sustainable, lasting fabrics and pay workers fair benefits and wages. Despite the initial cost, over time, you might save money and time as you won’t have to replace clothes too often.To lessen the financial impact you can shop secondhand (thrift stores also have quality clothing), start small, shop deals and save for the expensive items, such as a winter coat or high-end denim, months in advance.ㅇ['Fashion & Beauty', 'Personal Development', 'Money & Investments', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture', 'Productivity']
Title: Care For Your Garments Content: Fast fashion clothes aren’t made to last long, so we are less likely to properly care for them.

Title: Age And Metabolism Content: Age affects metabolism, making it slow over the years, even if you start out with a fast metabolism. Differences in metabolism speed are evident in how easy or hard it is for people to gain or lose weight.A slow metabolism burns fewer calories, thus storing more fat; that's why some people have difficulty losing weight by just cutting calories.

Title: Being Unable To Articulate Your Thoughts Content: Many introverts face difficulty in being able to articulate what is in their minds into words.Introverts process information in a much deeper way, trying to think of the exact word, and this prolonged word-retrieval exercise makes them ‘freeze’.Introverts like to chew on ideas and are not vocal about their deep, inner thoughts.ㅇ['Communication', 'Personal Development', 'Health', 'Psychology']
Title: FOMO and the quality of our experiences Content: FOMO make us want to accumulate as many experiences as possible, but at the same time, it robs those experiences of any real meaning.That's because it causes people to make their decisions based not on the reality of the experience, but rather the imagined experience.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Time Management', 'Love & Relationships']

"Title: The paradox of articulation Content: The careful searching for words we need stands in tension with the ignorance we hope it will remedy. The clarity we want seems to consist in the knowledge that we're thinking some specific thought.Jean-Paul Sartre touched on this paradox when he stated: ""This is indeed what linguists and psychologists have perceived … they believed that they discovered a circle in the formulation of speaking, for in order to speak it is necessary to know one's thought. But how can we know this thought as a reality made explicit and fixed in concepts except precisely by speaking it?"""ㅇ['Communication', 'Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Health']
Title: Language is a medium Content: Language functions as a medium for expressing thoughts and as a means for developing them.The act of expression exposes the gaps and carelessness of our thinking. This common experience could tempt us to think that whenever articulation is hard, and we finally arrive at the formulations, we add something new to our initial thoughts. This is only part of the picture. Our thoughts can be more definite than what we can readily articulate.ㅇ['Communication', 'Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Health']
Title: Learning more about a thought Content: We can learn more about a thought by drawing on a certain kind of knowledge of it. It is not explicit knowledge you can find in textbooks but a form of implicit knowledge.We can better recognize the correct words of this knowledge by an analogy with simpler forms of recognition. Our recognition of the words that match our thoughts is the result of our immediate experience.ㅇ['Communication', 'Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Health']

Title: Emotion and repetition Content: To make sense of the world, our brain makes neural pathways from its past experience. These pathways allow us to become efficient and not doubt every move we make. However, when we need to update our expectations to a new reality, our brain has to create new pathways. One tool is to use emotion, but it's limiting. The other is repetition. If you repeat a new behavior for 45 days, you will build a new expectation.To rewire yourself to focus on the good you want instead of disappointed expectations, use both emotion and repetition.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Health', 'Communication', 'Science & Nature']

Title: Machine Learning - How? What? and Why?  Content: “Machine Learning” , a term came out of nowhere is now the most trending one. Though, one might not know what is it actually? People are bound to many examples, but the exact idea seems to be different. People often mix up the terms Data Science, Machine Learning andArtificial Intelligence . These are different branches of study but one is related to each other and successive of one another. Machine Learning algorithms are fed with huge amount of data known as Sample Data . Before feeding the data, the data must be cleaned and should be properly formatted. This process is known as Data Pre-processing . A Machine Learning Model can never make 100% accurate predictions otherwise there is no point of training the Model.ㅇ['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Technology & The Future']

Title: How to be more Productive in Life! Content: Leave The Other Things Behind -Whatever you need to do at home, whatever you need to fix in your life, if now is not the time in which you can fix it thendo not worry about it now.Leave those things behind and focus on where you are. Deal with them when the time comes and only then.Make a Plan -So much time every day is lost because you do not have control over your time. The average person works less than 3 hours out of the 8 hour workday (Source:In an 8-Hour Day, the Average Worker Is Productive for This Many HoursFollow a schedule, make that schedule fun, and take control of your time; it is the limiting resource of your life.Challenge Yourself -Too few people really push their limits. They do what is necessary, fall short of that, and often stop there saying“It’s good enough” If you live by that philosophy you will also always fall short of your dreams and goals and have to settle for what you get with“It’s good enough”…The problem is, that it will not be good enough and you know it. So take the extra step and fight a little harder!Surround Yourself with Winning Attitudes -Listen to people that want to reach higher, spend time with those, read what they wrote and consume as much time as possible with them or the things created by them.Youarethe average of the people you spend the most time with. Be careful as to who that turns you into.What if you only had 4 hours? -This is the core message of the bookThe 4-hour Workweekby Timothy Ferriss. What if you only had 4 hours to work this week? What would you need to accomplish? What holds the highest priority? What would you leave behind?Work with this in the back of your mind and you will “Eat the Frog” (Brian Tracy)and do what is necessary because you took“Extreme Ownership”(Jocko Willink)resulting in a far more effective day.Smile and be Excitable -Think back as to how you felt during school on your birthday. You were giddy with excitement of the party you had after school, everything was about you that day, and, for some reason, even though the schoolwork was the same it felt a lot easier on those days.That is what excitement can do for you, so find a way to become excitable about what you do. Listen to upbeat music, watch some motivational, look at inspirational pictures/quotes and do what you need to to facilitate the emotion.Have Better Dreams -Many people dream far too small. They dream about things that arereasonableandachievablebut are not the things they truly desire. It is not surprising then that those people are not willing to work for it! If you actually wanted to make a million dollars but you are saying ten thousand is far more reasonable, will you really work with the same mindset? Will you struggle as long, grind as hard, and go as many extra steps for the 10k as you would for the 1M?Just Do It -At the end of the day, no matter what the other tips were or what you actually end up doing, the only thing that matters is that you work more. Forget the thoughts, the emotions, and the tricks and just sit down and do the work.You will not always feel up for it, there will often be other, better things you can do and sometimes your mind will make excuses sound like reasons.But it doesn’t matter.What matters is only what you actually accomplished when the day draws to a close. What did you do to make your life better? What did you finish at work? How productive were you really? You can blame everyone else, say that you do not know how to be more productive and come up with a million different reasons and excuses, but it will not change anything. What will change something is if you actually did something. Remember that!ㅇ[]
Title: The industrial age changed romance Content: For most of human history, there was no time for romance.

Title: The Process Of Transformation Through Contentment Content: When we feel a sense of contentment, our satisfaction influences our overall happiness.A simple, minimalistic way of life can help us curb many unwanted desires that cause misery in the future (including financial troubles).The contentment over our significant other boosts any relationship and avoids our efforts to change others into versions we like.Contentment leads us to accept our children and love them as they are, instead of imposing undesirable conditions on them.Being content with a good job helps us avoid being a complaining, grumpy person, leading to more opportunities in the future.Social change is possible if we are content with ourselves and can therefore work positively in the bigger issues that plague the earth.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Health', 'Love & Relationships']

Title: Pain: The Unwanted Discomfort Content: Pain, whether emotional or physical is practically unavoidable in the entire human existence.

Most people focus on learning about their own field, even though other fields have proven insights that are applicable. Build a lab, not an experiment. Entrepreneurs who can conduct more experiments will discover more new data and therefore have a big advantage. These entrepreneurs look at their business as a lab where they constantly run experiments. Many entrepreneurs fail here because they look at their business as one big experiment to test just one idea.Be good at pulling out the wisdom of others. Many successful people are not able to articulate how they do what they do. They just do it. Asking the right questions can help bring to the surface this tacit knowledge.

Title: 25 things to make you better.  Content: 1. Read at least one book per month.2. Write down your goals at the start of each week and each month.3. And measure and track those goals throughout the year – actually look each goal in the face and be honest with yourself about what you did do and what you could have done better.4. Dedicatejust one day a week to eating no meat.5. Turn your phone on silent before you share a meal with someone you care about.6. Talk to someone you trust when you’re in pain, even if it’s what you consider a ‘small pain.’7. Walk whenever you can and wherever you can.8. Do everything in your power to be considerate of and aware of other people.9. Say ‘yes’ to something that scares you, if you know that it will truly be good for you.10. Write every day in a notebook, with the understanding that there are no rules, no one will ever see it, and that it’s simply a tool for you to get your thoughts out of your head and onto a piece of paper.11. Become cognizant of your emotions in a way you never have before – by simply trying to address them and name them, instead of treating them like a silent companion that you ignore because you practically don’t even notice them.12. Listen more than you talk. And then forgive yourself when you fail at this. And then try again.13. Look at anything other than a screen in the minutes before you fall asleep. A book, the window, your partner, a pet, the ceiling. Anything that is not going to instantaneously bring you back into a world you are trying to take a break from for eight hours.14. Treat sleep as an absolute necessity and an incredibly important priority, instead of being proud of how little of it you are getting.15. Pay attention to the factors you need in which to do good work. Do you need music? Do you need silence? Do you need a window? Do you need white noise? Do you need to turn your phone face-down? Do you need scheduled breaks every 45 minutes to read a few pages in a book? Do you need to take a walk first or right in the middle of it all? Pay attention to the moments in which you’ve done your best work, notice the factors that were present in that experience, and then do everything in your power to replicate it every single time.16. Talk to strangers sometimes. Talk to your Uber driver when they seem to be in a chatty mood. Talk to your server about anything other than today’s happy hour specials. Talk to the person ringing up your dry cleaning and see how their day is going. Sometimes the interaction will be nice but forgettable. But sometimes you will still remember it several years from now. People have the most interesting things to say, when you’re listening.17. When you come up with a new goal and you feel that familiar thrill every time you think about it, tell someone about it. The effect of how much more real and tangible it becomes when you do this is incredible.18. Listen to white noise  when you need to study or focus or create, or when you just need your brain to quiet down for a bit.19. Pay attention to how many pointless things you do, and how many minutes you waste, in the moments or hours before you go to bed. When you find yourself doing these things, like clicking through ridiculous slideshows or doing a deep dive into someone’s Facebook, stop. Brush your teeth. And go to sleep. The more you try to catch yourself doing these things, the less you will do them.20. When you choose to relax, make sure you mentally and emotionally commit to it. Don’t half-ass it. Don’t sit on the couch and ‘rest’ while also checking emails and doing ‘something small’ for work and planning an upcoming trip. Just fully commit to relaxing. Immerse yourself in that movie or show or book or walk or yoga class or whatever. Let it be the only thing that you’re doing.21. Wear whatever is the best combination of making you feel comfortable, confident, and like yourself. These outfits exist, you just have to work a little harder to find them.22. Open your mail right away. Answer what needs to be answered, and throw out anything that is unnecessary. Do this immediately. When you do it for a while and have success and then four months later you’re back to your old ways, waste no time scolding yourself. It happens to all of us. Just start again.23. Tell people you are proud of them, thankful for them, inspired by them, grateful to them, here for them, honored to know them, and comforted by them.24. Make every decision, ever little choice, based on your desire to be a person of integrity.25. Think about where you were a year ago, five years ago, ten years ago. Think about all the things you are doing now that you wouldn’t have ever believed you could do back then. Then keep waking up every day striving to make the future you once again astounded and proud.ㅇ['Habits', 'Reading & Writing', 'Productivity', 'Mindfulness', 'Meditation']

"Title: Where honey comes from Content: Honey is made by bees. Bees eat nectar, a sugar-rich liquid that is produced by flowers.The bee stores most of the nectar in their ""honey stomach."" At the hive, bees regurgitate the nectar, blowing bubbles to evaporate the water. They also mix the nectar with their digestive enzymes, which break down the sugar, starch, and protein in the nectar, making it more acidic.Then the bees deposit the nectar into the honeycomb, where more water evaporates, and add caps to the honeycomb to seal the honey inside, ready for later consumption by larvae or adults when food is scarce.Beekeepers remove some honeycomb from hives and spin it to extract the thick liquid from inside.

"Title:  Content: If you would like to contribute translations, please e-mail me at la@sakinorva.net. You may inquire about advertising opportunities.This test has 96 questions.Your results will be calculated into a table using four different methods:The Grant/Brownsword model - though untrue to Grant's definitions for the types and their functions in From Image to Likeness: A Jungian Path in the Gospel Journey and those of Brownsword's in It Takes All Types! and Psychological Type: An Introduction , this test tries to reconcile the type development stack first proposed by Grant with the more MBTI-centric (as opposed to Jung-centric) definitions for the functions used by the typology community today. The axis-based model - this algorithm uses preferences for function axes to arrive at a type, a practice commonly used by magicians and typologists today. (Temporarily not a thing.)The Myers model - this algorithm stays as true as possible to how Isabel Myers had envisioned function orientations in her types, especially emphasizing the importance of the extraverted functions in determining type. (I may later expand on this in the FAQ.)The Myers-Briggs type indicator - this test also attempts to calculate your Myers-Briggs type through a careful examination of each question and how it would correlation with each of the eight preferences; though roundabout and based only on theoretical correlations, it is reasonable to assume that this result will be more accurate than the previously mentioned algorithms in determining your Myers-Briggs type .You can select five options per question, where the rightmost choice corresponds to ""agree"" and the leftmost choice corresponds to ""disagree."" The three options in the middle correspond to only moderate preferences for each side, the middle option being specifically for ""no preference for either side."" To aid you in remembering this, ""agree"" and ""disagree"" have been labeled on their corresponding columns.Scroll down to view your results after submitting.  What is the Grant-Brownsword function model? In 1983, William Harold Grant, along with Magdala Thompson and Thomas E. Clarke, authored a book relating Jungian personality types to the Gospel by correlating Biblical themes to Jung's functions. Titled From Image to Likeness: A Jungian Path in the Gospel Journey , the main purpose of this book was to encourage the reader to understand the importance and the meaning of ""God's image"" and how to evoke it within you on a journey from image to likeness. But this work contained a tidbit that would come to shape typology today: a new psychological model.Grant dubbed it the third major model , highlighting how it ""views Jung's functions and attitudes on the basis of a developmental typology."" This model was based on their observations from several hundred people involved in their retreats and workshops (frequently referenced as ""R/W"" throughout their preface) along with thousands of students from two universities; it specifically referred to four stages of development from the ages of six to fifty.Grant understood his model was a deviation from conventional interpretations of Jung's work and did not expect to ""find support within the Jungian tradition"" . In his own words, ""admittedly, it needed further testing."" Grant included his model in the book in order to encourage people to view their personalities not statically but dynamically .Alan W. Brownsword would end up writing It Takes All Types! in 1987, utilizing Grant's model ""in accordance with"" Myers-Briggs types. This is not actually the case; Brownsword seemed to share an incorrect belief with many personality theorists from his time about the nature of ""Type,"" and this caused him to commit categorical errors when interpreting Jungian theory and Myers' work with the MBTI. When talking about the E/I orientations of the tertiary and inferior functions, Brownsword only says that ""not all of students of Jung seem to agree with [the tertiary function sharing the same direction as the dominant function]"" and dismisses the more accepted**** interpretation of Jung's work claiming that the ""tertiary function"" would be introverted with a claim that ""it just doesn't seem to work that way."" Consider Brownsword's model to be an awkward amalgamation of Jungian psychological types, Myers-Briggs theory, W.H. Grant's third model, and his own interpretation of what's really going on.The function stack today originated with Grant and Brownsword, but has been popularized by figures like Linda Berens and Dario Nardi. There is a lot of history behind how this had come about, which you can read more about here: Full context: the cognitive functions . **** the idea of having an ""alternating stack"" where the functions would be ordered IEIE or EIEI is fundamentally against how Jung described the function attitudes. Jung never made a stack template, but if he did, the directions would only ever work with two exclusive directions (i.e. IEEE, EEII, and IIIE would be acceptable, but not IEEI). Brownsword talked about how the ""tertiary"" function would be introverted according to Jungian analysts but he really meant that a function in that position would be introverted in their (correct) analysis of Jung's work; ""tertiary"" functions are not a thing in Jung's Psychological Types. I don't understand—how is all of this calculated? I used to give the exact formulas for the calculations before, but I like the idea of the numbers themselves being publicly ambiguous. But I really don't have a reason to be obscure about how the formulas are set up:The Grant-Brownsword algorithm calculates a score for all sixteen possible types by adding up weighted totals for the dominant, auxiliary, and—very weakly—tertiary functions, then subtracting weighted inferior function totals in the final add-up. It would look something like this: a(dominant)+b(auxiliary)+c(tertiary)-d(inferior) = type_scoreThe axis-based algorithm will assume that there are no inferior functionsin your stack, and that functions on opposite ends create axes that you would either prefer or not prefer, so in other words, your scores for Ne/Si are compared to Ni/Se, and the same thing goes for Se/Ni and Ni/Se. The algorithm then tries to figure out which one of those four ""valued"" functions you prefer should be dominant, and voila! You get your type. Why isn't my Myers-Briggs result the same as my function result? Because they aren't the same thing. Your Myers-Briggs result is based on the letter values assigned to each question (for example, agreeing with question #42 most significantly increases your E, N, and P scores even though it would give you 2 points for ""Se"") and your two other results are based only on the raw function algorithms. They are scored differently and mean different things. How accurate is the test? That really depends on what ""accurate"" means to you. My test is only meant to take your answers, run the formulas, and give you a result based on those formulas; this test would be 100% accurate solely with regards to that. Whether or not your result will be an accurate reflection of your ""function type"" or your Myers-Briggs type is up for you to decide.But I should stress an important detail: I've received a little bit over 10k responses to date, and I've been able to compare purported Myers-Briggs types on this test with the types received on ""raw"" Form Q. Unfortunately, crossover data is scarce, and only about a tiny percentage of the slightly-less-than-10k responders (you can take tests more than once) have taken both the raw Form Q test and the function test. There is a slight NP/SJ bias in the margins, so I would seriously consider J for you if you scored ""strong/clear N"" and ""undifferentiated"" on J/P, or S if you scored ""undifferentiated"" and ""strong/clear P,"" etc. But my big problem is that I can't offset the results with numerical addends or subtrahends because the gaps between these results are often relative, not absolute.For now, I would just recommend interpreting your results with this in mind, but I may add a permalink for your results for inquiry purposes soon. But your test is totally inaccurate! The questions suck, and I know I'm definitely not the type I got. It's really anyone's guess what an ""accurate"" interpretation of the functions is, because such a thing doesn't actually exist. I know, crazy. Maybe you think those definitions are absolutely wrong, maybe somebody else thinks those definitions are absolutely correct. There isn't a consensus on what function theory is, and there frankly never will be.But if you do think you have all the answers, I added an option for people to choose an accuracy score for the test—not of their results since they haven't seen them—but for the questions in ""assessing"" your functions. It's a little dumb because no one actually knows which question scores for which function before they get their results, but it would be a little wonky adding post-result data to already-submitted results. I'm sure there's a way, and I'll have to experiment with what works best.  #31"ㅇ['Strategy', 'Economics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Learning & Education', 'Science & Nature']

Title: I am excited Content: Needless to say, our appraisal of whether an event feels like a threat, or an opportunity, will depend on our circumstances and our resources to handle the problems we encounter. But it is sometimes possible to change our appraisal of a situation consciously . In one memorable experiment , Alison Wood Brooks, an associate professor at Harvard Business School, asked participants to face their fears of public speaking. Brooks found that simply asking the participants to repeat the phrase “I am excited” helped to reduce their anxious feelings and led to a better overall performance, since it encouraged them to view the situation as a new challenge rather than a threat. Many psychotherapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy, have also been found to increase our resilience by helping us to reframe stressful events in more constructive ways.ㅇ['Religion & Spirituality', 'Psychology', 'Health', 'Travel', 'Mental Health']

Clinical depression is more severe, such as losing sleep or thinking life isn't worth living and extends for a longer period. Lumping them together and ignoring the differing causes may lead to an inappropriate therapeutic approach.

Title: Product Market For is a Myth Content: There is no clear or consistent demarcation for fit vs. non-fit. Fundemantally it boils down to a “feeling,” rather than a scientifically measurable binary. And this leads entrepreneurs to make silly mistakes:  They are told to believe that pre-fit is a time for discovery and learning while post-fit is a time for scale. But product strategy shouldn’t do a 180° based on an arbitrary “feeling” of fit vs. non-fit.Marketers take a hands-off  approach before product-market fit is declared. They declare “we can’t find product-market fit,” when in fact, they didn’t invest enough in finding customers, at profitable rates, to sustain the business.ㅇ['Startups', 'Marketing & Sales']

What are the real benefits and why? Let’s take a closer look at the biology.ㅇ['Exercise & Fitnesss', 'Health', 'Sports', 'Meditation', 'Science & Nature']
Title: Phase #3: Recovery breath (short retention on full inhale) Content: When we finally need to breathe, we take a very deep breath and hold for about 15 seconds. The purpose of this is to quickly reset the body’s O2 levels . As the blood CO2 levels are now at normal or elevated levels, the body will use this O2 efficiently (again, due to the Bohr Effect).Most practitioners of this breathing technique could hold this retention much longer than 15 seconds, but Wim Hof recommends this length of time for an efficient reset. Too long, and O2 levels will start to drop again.At the end you should feel a natural “high” feeling mainly from the relaxation and adrenaline 🙂ㅇ['Exercise & Fitnesss', 'Health', 'Sports', 'Meditation', 'Science & Nature']

Other words such as 'Greek', 'Egypt', and 'temple' could be identified. But the demotic text (a cursive form of hieroglyphs) was not an alphabet, nor completely unrelated to hieroglyphic.In 1815, an English scientist and polymath, Thomas Young, traced how the pictographic hieroglyphs, showing people, animals, plants and other objects, had developed into their abstract, cursive equivalents in demotic. Young concluded that demotic consisted of a mixture between hieroglyphics and letters of the alphabet.ㅇ['Communication', 'Personal Development', 'Reading & Writing', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture']

Title: Information and decision making Content: The fact that we live in an age of information should allow us to make super-informed, data-driven decisions all the time.But the widespread availability of information does not mean that we actually use it even if we have it: decades of research in psychology and behavioral science found that people readily make data-poor snap judgments in a variety of instances (when forming impressions, when shopping, when evaluating, even when voting).ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Teamwork', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Snap judgments Content: Individuals fail to anticipate how little information they and others use when making decisions.An the immediacy of human judgment generally surprises people: we are startled by how quickly we make judgments and how little information we use doing so.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Teamwork', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: The Art Of Studying: Revision Content: During studies, how we revise what we have learned is a personal preference, which we incorporate after trial and error and what feels intuitive or effective to us.According to research, the popular revising methods like rereading, highlighting and summarizing don’t seem to work as effectively as previously thought.ㅇ['Learning & Education']

Title: Research Findings On Supplements Content: Pharmaceuticals undergo extensive testing to prove they're effective and safe before they can be sold, but dietary supplements can be sold without proof of claims, effectiveness or safety.Daily multivitamin consumption does not lower heart disease risk.The FDA has found more than 500 supplements adulterated with pharmaceuticals or closely related compounds. Those can cause unwanted side effects and may be especially risky when taken with heart drugs or other prescription medications.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Science & Nature']
Title: Supplements And Doctor Prescriptions Content: Because of the potential risks and unclear benefits of supplements, most doctors advise against them. However, doctors often recommend specific vitamin and mineral supplements to their patients, such as calcium and vitamin D to prevent osteoporosis and iron for people with iron deficiency.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Science & Nature']
Title: When Buying Supplements Content: Consider only single-ingredient supplements. Multi-ingredient supplements make it hard to identify which substance is having an effect and they are more likely to be adulterated with banned drugs.Tell your doctor about any supplement you take, so they can check it will interact with any of the medicines you're on.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Science & Nature']

Title: Resist The Urge For a Quick Fix Content: Back when undernutrition and vitamin deficiencies were widespread, supplements made some sense. But now one of the more urgent health problems is obesity and overnutrition while a growing body of studies shows that supplements’ effects are minimal or negative.Remember that you can’t know for sure what's really in your supplement bottle. And that the pills probably won't make you any healthier (unless you have a medically diagnosed deficiency). And they might even be hurting you.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Science & Nature']

Title: Results On Multivitamins Content: In studies testing the four common supplements of multivitamins, vitamin D, calcium and vitamin C, there was no reduction in the incidence of heart disease, stroke or premature death.Folic acid supplements showed a reduction in heart disease and stroke. But high levels of folic acid in the blood may increase the risk of prostate cancer.Among those taking statin medication to lower blood cholesterol, slow or extended release vitamin B3 (niacin) increased the risk of early death by 10%.Antioxidant supplements also had a marginally significant increase of early that risk.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Science & Nature']
Title: Research: the road not taken Content: Since it is unclear in advance which research direction will yield results, scientific progress needs independent explorers.

Title: Marketing And Product Development Taught By A Blockbuster Game Content: Animal Crossing: New Horizons sold 13 million copies in six weeks, making it one of the most popular games of modern times. The universal, de-stressing nature of the game contrasted with what 2020 unleashed at the same time in the month of March.One of the first marketing lessons that Nintendo, the developer of the runaway hit game provided was that timing is everything.ㅇ['Business', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Startups', 'Marketing & Sales']
Title: Don’t Give Everything Away For Free Content: Nintendo restricted players who have bought the ‘Switch’ console which plays the hit game, to only be able to create one island.

"Title: The two-stage process of creativity Content: Human creativity is our ability to move to and fro between the realms of ""what is"" and ""what could be.""Creativity is a two-stage process:It's the ability to work through a challenge or an idea by imagining possible outcomes that are not immediately evident.It's the capacity to make that imagined outcome into a reality.Creativity is not only about genius or limited to the work of original thinkers. Creativity appears from the interconnections of ideas, experiences, and imagination."ㅇ['Creativity']
Title: The Daydreaming Network Content: Our brains have many regions, like the prefrontal cortex, medial temporal lobes and the parietal cortex cluster, allowing us to imagine and visualize complex scenarios and their possible outcomes inside our minds. This makes daydreaming a complex and rich phenomenon which we take for granted.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Health', 'Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Science & Nature']
Title: Creativity: The Elusive Butterfly Content: Creative inspiration is elusive, and it is a common fact that some people are more creative than others.

Creativity can be ‘grown’ with the right soil and sunlight, and is not just a thing people are born with.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Creativity']
Title: The ability to communicate jokes Content: Children first need to possess a few basic cognitive skills to communicate jokes, such as imagination, the ability to take a different perspective, and language.These abilities tend to develop at different rates in children and continue to grow and change throughout adolescence and adulthood.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Entertainment', 'Science & Nature']
Title: Language and humor Content: Most types of humour involve the realisation of contradiction, or a mismatch, between a concept and a situation. In other words, we laugh when things surprise us because they are out of place. Even simple games like peek-a-boo have an element of surprise where someone suddenly appears out of nowhere.Researchers think that communication is essential for humor and that humor facilitates the process of learning a language.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Entertainment', 'Science & Nature']
Title: Mindfulness As Part Of Treatment Content: The common treatments of depression are antidepressant medications and therapy, which has a large relapse rate.However, if mindfulness is part of the treatment, the relapse rate declines. What is being pointed out is that mindfulness is effective when it is part of a treatment, and not so much on its own.ㅇ['Health', 'Mental Health', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology']
Title: Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) Content: This is a therapeutic treatment combining cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and mindfulness practices. MBCT helps the depressed person understand that 1) Thoughts are not facts; and 2) Depression is not to be identified with.MBCT takes care of our behavioural patterns as well as our thought patterns, making the treatment a thorough approach towards depression, taking care of the mind and body.ㅇ['Health', 'Mental Health', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology']
Title: The Meaning Of Meaning Content: The meaning of life generally means the relevance, significance or value of the same.The quest for meaning is not a simple one,  but a rabbit’s hole of further queries, making the concept of ‘meaning’ confusing even for positive psychologists.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Philosophy', 'Health', 'Communication']
Title: Meaning: Global And Situational Content: Global (or ultimate) meaning talks about the intrinsic meaning of life as it is, and is a functional way of understanding the world around us. It works on the notion that ‘ignorance is bliss’.Situational meaning is more dynamic and can be applied to every moment in our lives, looking at it as a separate, meaningful event.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Philosophy', 'Health', 'Communication']
Title: Emotions as feedback Content: Others can be motivated by giving feedback on changes in emotion, behaviour, and well-being.Praise can create positive emotions, while mastery programs can increase a sense of competence.Positive feedback, expressing gratitude and awe can be used to induce change.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Health', 'Problem Solving', 'Motivation & Inspiration']
Title: Learning self-control Content: Monitoring one's goal-setting progress increases our capacity to persevere with our long-term goals on our own. Self-control is the central part of the process of self-regulation and is essential for sustained motivation.Our ability to suppress, restrain, and override a desire or temptation is quickly depleted when we pursue a long-term goal. We can increase our ability for self-control by good nutrition, training, experiencing a positive effect, and when our psychological needs are met.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Health', 'Problem Solving', 'Motivation & Inspiration']
Title: Motivation and stress Content: Stress can impact our motivation. To cope with stressors involve planning, execution, and feedback.During planning, we analyze if a life-changing event is positive, negative, or irrelevant to our well-being. If it is a negative event, we find resources to manage the event.During execution, we determine how to cope with the stressor. When the stressor is low, reappraisal is a good strategy, but when the stress is very high, distraction is more effective.During feedback, we can use it to reappraise the stressor or to change coping and emotion regulation strategies.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Health', 'Problem Solving', 'Motivation & Inspiration']
"Title: S Content: Satisfactory qualityis harder to define. The law says ""satisfactory"" is what areasonable person wouldbe happy with, looking at all of the information easily available to you, such as its price and condition. See more later onsecond-hand goods .But what's reasonable ? Now there's a question lawyers have rowed about for years and there's no set answer.In a legal context and in a dispute with a shop, it means goods must be in a state that you, or any other normal, reasonable person would think was reasonable. Easy, eh?Certainly if you bought an expensive music player and the sound was virtually inaudible, most people would almost certainly say it wasn't satisfactory. But let's say you bought a cheap garden trampoline, where you could bounce on it, but it moved around as it wouldn't bed into the soil. Would that be satisfactory?Ultimately if you and the shop couldn't resolve it, you'd need to take it to court for a judge to decide. But hopefully, it wouldn't get that far."ㅇ[]
Title: Mindlessness Content: Mindlessness, or going on autopilot, can result in missing the good things in life or ignoring important information about relationships or health.The antidote is to practice to pay more careful attention to what is going on around you as well as inside of you.ㅇ['Mindfulness', 'Meditation', 'Personal Development', 'Health']

Title: Habits that prevent you from being wealthy Content: However, there are much safer investment options, such as bank and government-funded schemes, ISAs, bonds, and investment projects. Investing in these means you’re not only keeping the money safe for a few years so you can’t spend it, but you’re also making a percentage of the money back. Naturally, humans seek comfort zones because it means there’s less to worry about, but if you want to become financially secure and grow wealth, you need to keep climbing higher and higher; about as far as you can go. Fortunately, you live in the modern world, so there are plenty of ways to do this. On the other hand, pretty much every single millionaire in the world has the habit of reading  with the intention to learn and grow. Coincidence? I think not. Of course, reading is fun for entertainment purposes, but you need to diversify your reading choices and get some books on subjects you want to know about, whether that’s investing, starting your own business, or learning a new skill. You cannot work 24/7 all the time and expect yourself not to burn out. However, if you have things to make your list and you end just playing games or shopping or watching TV or movies, this is procrastinating. These activities do not grow you or have a final outcome apart from that time you’ve just spent doing those things is now gone forever.ㅇ['Economics', 'Career', 'Money & Investments', 'Startups', 'Entrepreneurship']
Title: Why we procrastinate Content: Real procrastination, which afflicts an estimated 20% of us, isn't the same as laziness, being disorganised, or putting off boring chores. It's an active avoidance strategy, and because it's usually rooted in the fear of failure, or success, or loss of control, it most affects exactly those things that really matter to us, not the chores.ㅇ['Time Management', 'Productivity', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology']
Title: Inspiration when you need it most Content: Inspiration is hard to look for when you're cooped up in your room, but it can be found through the form of gratitude, curiosity, or awe. Here are ways to look for inspiration: Practice journaling in details about the things you are thankful for havingGo for a short walk around the block and encourage yourself to seek the beauty of things Be creative in other ways or just sit still and focus on yourself. Whatever suits your groove.ㅇ['Mindfulness', 'Health', 'Mental Health', 'Meditation', 'Science & Nature']
Title: Motivation and creative work Content: Intrinsic motivation is necessary for creative work.We need broad thinking, so we can come up with innovative ideas and see new connections.Extrinsic motivation narrows our thinking by focusing on getting the task done so we can earn the reward.It's providing you an external incentive to work hard.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Time Management', 'Productivity', 'Motivation & Inspiration']
Title: For Most Adults Content: For the average person, a cup or two of coffee shouldn’t impact your health or your sleep–provided you time it right. 200mg to 300mg or two to four cups of coffee is safe to consume. While rare, a caffeine overdose occurs at around 15 mg/L. To put it into perspective, an average person would need to down well over ten cups to reach those levels.ㅇ['Habits', 'Exercise & Fitnesss', 'Food', 'Health', 'Meditation']

Title: A process-oriented mindset Content: Process-oriented confidence is the opposite of the “fake it till you make it” philosophy.While the “fake it till you make it” approach suggests we should pretend our way toward true confidence, the process-oriented approach suggests we should become our way toward true confidence.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Psychology']

Title: There are no perfect parents, kids, humans Content: Perfection.It doesn’t exist.Those ideals we have?They are GUIDING STARS not distant shores.In other words, one more time: We’re never going to arrive at Perfectville.As Carl Rogers tells us (via our Notes on Tal Ben Shahar’s must re-read The Pursuit of Perfect), ‘The good life is a process, not a state of being. It is a direction, not a destination.”This is also a good time to remind ourselves of Abraham Maslow’s wisdom.Yes, he said “‘What one can be, one must be.”ㅇ['Books']

Title: Keys points and conclusions  Content: The more friends the merrier? Sometimes. But whether you have a ton of friends or just a couple, what matters is how you treat one another and if you can turn to them in times of need.Whether you’re a billionaire or don’t have much in your wallet, the amount of money you have or are making doesn’t define your worth. “Going deep into debt to create a façade of wealth backfires in the end because while goods and services have monetary value, they don't reflect your value as a human being,” Morin writes.Bottom line: Your worth is entirely up to you. You are worthy because you say you're worthy and because you believe it. Look within, and trust that you are enough.ㅇ['Motivation & Inspiration', 'Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Career', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture']

Title: The Love Of A TV Tray Content: TV trays were a practical household ‘mini furniture’ back in the early days when television had all but six channels. It helped families eat in a secure manner, with dishes intact, posture upright, and less spillage. It also helped navigate the TV better due to the space for the remote control(s).The beautifully designed trays added glamour and fun to eating while watching TV, which was a treat in itself even though there were few things to watch.ㅇ['Food', 'Mindfulness', 'Meditation']
Title: Sugar slows the brain down Content: A diet high in sugar makes learning difficult by slowing the brain down.

Title: Practice self-compassion Content: Particularly in the West, people have adopted a propensity for self-criticism as a cultural value, and tend to self-punish when dealing with setbacks and failures, she says. But excessive self-criticism gets in the way of achieving your goals.There are three parts to practicing self-compassion, and they draw on some of the other exercises on this list: Be present in the moment rather than dwelling on the past or looking anxiously to the future. Understand that setbacks are part of being human, and all people experience them. Cultivate a warm, supportive inner voice rather than a hostile, self-critical one.ㅇ['Personal Development']
Title: The first step Content: Sugar is responsible for a number of medical conditions, including obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Sugar depletes your energy and can contribute to depression.Removing sugar from your diet can make you feel better and can decrease your health risks.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Personal Development']

Title: Be Comfortable With Good Enough Content: What prevents people from taking a risk is thinking that you can't start until everything is perfect.We need the courage to make decisions with imperfect data and move forward as information becomes available.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Listening to the other side Content: We tend to focus on what we're going to say next in conversation and we fail to understand the counterargument and really listen to the other party.Demonstrate that you're listening by reframing their position in your words and then ask forconfirmation that you have it right.ㅇ['Teamwork', 'Communication', 'Personal Development', 'Leadership & Management', 'Psychology']

Title: Overlooking context in leadership forming Content: Many training initiatives assume that the same group of skills or leadership styles are suitable without considering the strategy or organizational culture of a company.An excellent leader in one situation does not necessarily perform well in another. Focusing on context means equipping leaders with two or three competencies that will make a distinction to performance, rather than a list of leadership standards that is of no specific benefit.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Corporate Culture', 'Leadership & Management', 'Marketing & Sales']

Title: Mindfulness has been repackaged Content: Although mindfulness originated from Buddhism, it has been stripped from most of its teachings.What remains is nothing more than a self-help tool to help one get used to the very conditions that caused the problems. While is it a noble aim to reduce stress and anxiety, it is more important to acknowledge and address the underlying cause of the suffering.ㅇ['Mindfulness', 'Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Psychology']
"Title: The message of the mindfulness Content: The message of the mindfulness movement is that the underlying cause is in our mind - a ""thinking disease"" or a kind of attention deficit disorder.Rather than discussing how attention is monetized and manipulated by corporations, mindfulness advocates to view the crisis as an internal battle. The result is that we meekly retreat into the private sphere without critically engaging with the causes of suffering in the structures of power and economic systems of capitalist society."ㅇ['Mindfulness', 'Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Psychology']

Title: ASMR: The tingling sensation Content: ASMR is a personal, individual experience, with very little science behind it. People enjoy a deeply relaxing whispering video or a role-play, which gives them a tingling sensation on the back of their head and spine. It may be a mundane, monotonous activity like tapping, stirring, or crinkling objects, but they kick in a pleasure sensation in many.The feeling varies and is somewhat similar to a sexual turn-on, in many cases.ㅇ['Videos', 'Entertainment']

Title: Added Sugar vs. Natural Sugar Content: Added sugar is unfriendly to our health. It can be found in most food products we come across. It is absorbed by the body quicker unlike natural sugar.Processed food is digested quickly as soon as it enters out intestine while fiber-rich foods break down slowly and travel farther down the digestive track making us feel fuller.Foods containing natural sugar and fiber allow the body to feed the healthy bacteria in our gut and supports the health of our own microbiome.ㅇ['Health', 'Food']
Title: Avoid Grapes and Bananas When Cutting Down On Sugar Content: Bananas and grapes are delicious fruits but they contain high amounts of fiber and natural sugar (fructose).

Title:  Content: Be careful about how personal you go I took French throughout my schooling, and something I heard again and again over the years was not to ask a French person what their job is. In France and around Europe, it’s considered an overly personal question, and topics like politics are considered a more neutral — and intellectual — conversation space. This probably comes out of the fact that in Europe, where class has a longer and perhaps more complicated history, your profession has historically been deeply attached to your social status, and your social status has been trenchantly difficult to change. Asking a profession, then, amounts to asking, “what’s your social status?” In America, where we like to think of class as something changeable and thus less defining, and where work has less historically inscribed relationship to class, we don’t lend the question so much weight.ㅇ['Career', 'Communication', 'Teamwork', 'Videos', 'Love & Relationships']
Title:  Content: Be honest It can be tempting to slip into platitudes and white lies in an attempt to stay likable — a new study has shown that we associate a lot of fear with being honest, because we expect a negative reaction (and perhaps dislike) from our conversation partners as a result. But these fears are actually largely unfounded: People don’t usually have the negative reactions to honesty that we expect, and we end up feeling really great, too, after speaking up honestly.The study notes two main kinds of honest talk that you can draw on for this: Give honest feedback (at work, this might mean some constructive criticism about a colleague’s performance), and answer personal questions honestly — if someone at a party asks you how you’re doing, answer with how you’re really feeling, even if that means saying something like, “Actually, I’m feeling really overwhelmed right now.” Then use the opportunity to follow up with a question about your conversation partner: “Have you ever felt like you were struggling to keep up with everything? How do you cope when you do?”ㅇ['Career', 'Communication', 'Teamwork', 'Videos', 'Love & Relationships']

Title:  Content: Everything has a resonance at a particular frequency which we may or may not perceive, depending on our own unique abilities. Many believe that beings interact with us and work with us on a daily basis, but we can't perceive them due to their higher rate of vibration. If you accept this, and I acknowledge not everyone does, then you must also consider the potential for other negative forces or energies to surround us that are also not perceptible.  The Universal Law of Polarity suggests that everything has an opposite. them, but that does not negate their existence or their influence.ㅇ['Religion & Spirituality', 'Mental Health', 'Meditation', 'Science & Nature']
Title:  Content: So what does this mean in regards to entities and interference? Negative thoughts, emotions and intent, all resonate at a particular vibration. This vibration tends to coalesce into what some term as fourth dimensional energy. It's basically the chaos of the world that has no specific form or body, but coalesces due to mutual attraction, all resonating around a similar frequency. It's all around us and part of us, and it's this chaos that offers the potential for some energies to take form in co-creation with us. In other words, we create them, most commonly through fear and anger.ㅇ['Religion & Spirituality', 'Mental Health', 'Meditation', 'Science & Nature']

Title:  Content: They Keep Their Emotions Separate from Their Financial Decisions “If you cannot control your emotions, you cannot control your money.” – Warren Buffett  We’re all human. Which means that it’s only natural that our emotions influence our decision-making process. Even though it’s impossible to completely separate our emotions from the decisions that we make, the mentally strong take to heart Buffett’s advice. One of the ways they’re able to do that is by summoning the counsel of trusted financial and investment experts, with whom they have established strong relationships (which refers back to my second point!). They understand that their financial mentors can help them limit risk, leverage turnkey solutions to realize their financial goals faster and help them prevent their emotions from getting a hold of themselves before making important financial decisions.ㅇ['Cryptocurrency', 'Books', 'Personal Development', 'Money & Investments', 'Podcasts']

Because they expand their financial horizons by collaborating with like-minded people and end up being that much more confident with their money. Still not convinced?

Title:  Content: They Maintain a Positive Outlook Toward Their Finances “My attitude has always been, if you fall flat on your face, at least you’re moving forward. All you have to do is get back up and try again.” – Richard Branson  Mentally strong people subscribe to Branson’s notion that a positive attitude puts them in a position of control over their circumstances. They also apply this same principle toward their finances. In fact, research has shown that positivity is a hallmark of nearly all financially well-off individuals. You can follow in their footsteps too. Start by affirming out loud your financial goals for 2017. Remember, be specific and confident (for example, “I will  successfully  save at least 10% of my income.”). Voicing your goals with confidence is proven to help you better ingrain positivity into your brain and follow through on your plans.     Once you have those positive vibes flowing, write down your goals, so that you can monitor your progress throughout the year.ㅇ['Cryptocurrency', 'Books', 'Personal Development', 'Money & Investments', 'Podcasts']
Title: Strengthen your connection to yourself Content: Psychologist Anne Wilson has manipulated people's perception of time. By using a longer timeline, such as a due date that is far off, people feel more connected to their future selves.Hal Hershfield, an assistant professor, used a virtual reality room to show subjects a digitally older version of themselves. The result is that participants were more likely to make responsible choices for their future selves.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychology', 'Communication']
Title: Partial Differentiation Content: Partial differential equations can describe everything from planetary motion to plate tectonics, but they’re notoriously hard to solve.The first thing to understand here is that neural networks are fundamentally function approximators. (Say what?) When they’re training on a data set of paired inputs and outputs, they’re actually calculating the function, or series of math operations, that will transpose one into the other. Think about building a cat detector. You’re training the neural network by feeding it lots of images of cats and things that are not cats (the inputs) and labeling each group with a 1 or 0, respectively (the outputs). The neural network then looks for the best function that can convert each image of a cat into a 1 and each image of everything else into a 0. That’s how it can look at a new image and tell you whether or not it’s a cat. It’s using the function it found to calculate its answer—and if its training was good, it’ll get it right most of the time.Now here’s the crux of the paper. Neural networks are usually trained to approximate functions between inputs and outputs defined in Euclidean space, your classic graph with x, y, and z axes. But this time, the researchers decided to define the inputs and outputs in Fourier space, which is a special type of graph for plotting wave frequencies. The intuition that they drew upon from work in other fields is that something like the motion of air can actually be described as a combination of wave frequencies, says Anima Anandkumar, a Caltech professor who oversaw the research alongside her colleagues, professors Andrew Stuart and Kaushik Bhattacharya. The general direction of the wind at a macro level is like a low frequency with very long, lethargic waves, while the little eddies that form at the micro level are like high frequencies with very short and rapid ones.ㅇ['Strategy', 'Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Learning & Education', 'Science & Nature']

Title: Choose an interesting career over a fun career Content: There are two basic types of speeches from commencement speakers: One is to “Go find your purpose.” The other is “Find work you love and you’ll never work a day in your life.” Scholars refer to two kinds of happiness as hedonic and eudaemonia. Hedonic is about feeling good; eudaemonia is about living a purpose-filled life. But hedonic alone results in empty pleasure and eudaemonia by itself can become dry. In reality, we need a balance of enjoyable and meaningful. If you find something that genuinely interests you, it will lead to being intensely pleasurable.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Health', 'Time Management', 'Leadership & Management']

Most of us fall prey to the same handful of issues because aspects of probability go against what we think is intuitive.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Entertainment']
Title: Assuming events are independent when they are not Content: When two event are interconnected, the former happening increases or decreases the probability of the latter happening. Your car insurance gets more expensive after an accident because car accidents are not independent events. A person who gets in one is more likely to get into another in the future.Most of our plans don’t go as we’d like. We get delayed, we have to backtrack, we have to make unexpected changes. Sometimes we think we can compensate for a delay in one part of a plan by moving faster later on. But the parts of a plan are not independent. A delay in one area makes delays elsewhere more likely as problems compound and accumulate.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Entertainment']
Title: Not understanding when events are independent Content: In Naked Statistics, Charles Wheelan explains: “A different kind of mistake occurs when events that are independent are not treated as such . . . If you flip a fair coin 1,000,000 times and get 1,000,000 heads in a row, the probability of getting heads on the next flip is still 1/2. The very definition of statistical independence between two events is that the outcome of one has no effect on the outcome of another.”ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Entertainment']

Title: How to maintain an antilibrary Content: Make notes of all relevant references. When an author mentions another book, make a note of the exact reference, then research it. In the process, you will discover books that genuinely piques your curiosity that can be added to your antilibrary.Ask fellow readers for recommendations. Allow for chance discoveries. Ensure you leave space for interesting books that you randomly bought because the title or cover grabbed your attention.Do not expect the proportion of unread books to decrease. The more you read, the more unread books will be added to your antilibrary.Improve your relationship with knowledge. Your antilibrary may feel a bit anxiety-inducing. Remember that knowledge is a process, not a possession. An antilibrary is an investment in yourself.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Learning & Education', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Reading & Writing']

Title: We Don’t Know What Productivity Really Is Content: Most of us want to be productive but do not completely understand what we do, why we do it, and who judges it as productive or non-productive.Productivity can be defined as the effectiveness of an effort, measured in terms of input and output. This definition is limited, as modern knowledge work does not fall in the category of industries (like a sugar factory) or agriculture, where productivity can be measured tangibly, and the output is already defined in a linear way.ㅇ['Time Management', 'Productivity', 'Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Entrepreneurship']

Title: Poison as reflection of medicine - II Content: Therefore ancient Ayurveda and Atharva Veda both included the study of this vital side of healing as well, i.e. poison.Measured poisons of many varying kinds at specific doses were studied, to treat major ailments that posed a long-term threat to the solar body that we house.As discussed in the earlier piece, we know that the observer’s role is grounded, pure, and without judgment. When one thinks of science as a discipline, it is simply an art that tries to define consciousness through varied sub-disciplines.Biology is one such beautiful sub-discipline that studies plant and animal life in detail and this has led to the taxonomy and record of the millions of kinds of manifestations of life force that have been present, are present, and also try and predict possible genetic combinatorics for the future.ㅇ['Religion & Spirituality', 'Philosophy']
Title: Poison as reflection of medicine - IV Content: There is always an anomaly in the ultimate order of things and that is how it will always work as well, and similarly, we see that anomaly in the snake kingdom for just one particular species.The king of all poisons, the King Cobra .Majestic and ever so spectacular, this marvelous creation has been named Ophiophagus hannah and rightly so.Ophiophagus as a word meaning itself is that it is the snake that eats other snakes .ㅇ['Religion & Spirituality', 'Philosophy']

Title: Why leaders struggle with authenticity Content: In trying to improve our game, a firm sense of self is a compass, but when we want to change our game, a too rigid self-concept can prevent us from moving forward.In global business, we often work with people who don't share our cultural norms. They may have a different expectation for how we should behave than what feels authentic.In today's world of connectivity, how we present ourselves is a critical aspect of leadership. We have to carefully curate a persona and that can clash with our private sense of self.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Corporate Culture', 'Career', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: The Trait Of Narcissism Content: Narcissism is a personality trait that makes a person represent an excessive, almost exclusive focus on the self, putting the social structure out of balance and leading to toxic behaviour, especially at the workplace. Narcissists can appear charismatic and leader-like, but eventually come across as needy, egoistic people craving for attention and validation.Showcasing drive, self-confidence and a desire to lead brings productive results, but leads to negative outcomes if it is self-centered.ㅇ['Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Love & Relationships', 'Communication', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: Saying Stuff We Regret Content: We are all social creatures, susceptible to say something that may offend others.We blurt out stuff, and it is at most a harmless mistake to us, but words hurt others more than anything.The wound our words make is an internal one and as needs a ‘repair’ process that is not like simply apologizing when we accidently bump into someone on the elevator.ㅇ['Communication', 'Personal Development', 'Love & Relationships', 'Psychology']

Great example is Michael Phelps who practiced swimming 6 hours daily for 6 years.2. Having realised this, still most people fail to follow consistent routines and practice. This is so because they are trying to avoid inconvenience and discomfort associated with practice.3. The key here is self-control. When the body, senses say, give up, when you feel pain, you have to endure that pain, that inconvenience, boredom and discomfort.

Title: Mathematics of motivation Content: When Ivan Pavlov and his dogs led to the discovery of learned behaviour through repeated exposure, and Edward Thorndike discovered the Law of Effect that stated that rewarded behaviours tended to increase, many psychologists were impelled to separate psychology from armchair introspection and formulated their theories as mathematical formulas.The Drive x HabitTheory. Clark Hull's formula was sEr = D x sHr, which states that excitatory tendency (E) is the result of the drive (D) combined with the habit (H). The drive is nonspecific, such as hunger or thirst. The habit, however, depends on the stimulus (s) and response (r). But the theory turned out to be wrong and even opposite in many cases.Expectation x Value Theory.Drawing on ideas in economics and game theory, Edward Tolman and Kurt Lewis formulated an alternative account by evaluating motivation based on expectations. Tolman expressed the ideas as the mathematical formula: Subjective Expected Utility = Probability1 * Utility1 + P2U2 + P3U3 + … where subjective expected utility of an action equalled the motivation to act. But, if you expect a reward, why act and not simply passively wait for the expected reward?ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychology', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Health']
"Title: Motivation as change Content: Donald Hebb realised that existing theories were too focused on reacting to the immediate environment. Thoughts, ideas and goals could be just as strong for triggering action as sights and sounds.Together with John Atkinson, they noted that the study of motivation had undergone a ""paradigm shift"", where motivation couldn't be seen as how actions get started, but how the organism decides to change its behaviour from one thing to another."ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychology', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Health']
"Title: The neuroscience of motivation Content: Neuroscience offers clues on how motivation works within the brain.Taking action. The motor loop in the brain enables one-action-at-a-time control. (We can't sit down and stand up at the same time.)The dopamine network explains which action we will pick. It signals to the brain which action will bring a reward. It uses that anticipation to guide our thoughts and behaviour.Addiction is a motivational disorder. Some drugs act directly upon the motivational circuitry of the brain, and cause the motivation to do something to far exceeds its value.Fear and anxiety compel us to do the opposite of motivation. The amygdala is a ""threat detection centre"" and forces us to suppress and avoid actions when we are anxious."ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychology', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Health']
Title: Motivation and psychological needs Content: People have three basic psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Our internal motivations often depend on how these needs are met.Goals that satisfy these needs tend to be more motivating, while goals that don't may cause harm. The underlying reasons for a goal may matter more.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychology', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Health']
Title: Modelling motivation: rationality, signaling and bias Content: Rational choice theory suggests that human behaviour is underpinned by the motivations of each individual. More specifically, this theory models human beings as utility-maximizers, according to a set of preferences. If you give people a set of actions to choose from, they will do whatever improves their utility the most. Signalling is the idea of taking an action because of what it communicates about you. For example, we care more for credentials in education than learning. The prospect theory states that we are reliably irrational in our decision-making. One possible bias is loss aversion that argues that we'll work harder to avoid losses than to get equivalent gains.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychology', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Health']
Title: Balancing Act Content: One of the most critical things you will learn in your lifetime is how to balance reality with expectation.The Universe would like to make perfectly clear that expectation is vastly different from manifestation.Today, you are being invited to look at your expectations and see how many are valid.If you find they are not, it is time make some changes; release and begin manifesting a different reality for yourself. ~ Creatorㅇ['Religion & Spirituality', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Philosophy', 'Mindfulness', 'Love & Relationships']
Title: A great conversation is often more about listening than talking Content: Good conversationalists actively listen.Many people take listening for granted as a conversation skill — listening is increasingly becoming a lost art. Many of us place an unusually high value on the opportunity to share their thoughts and feelings.People communicate to connect. If you are interested in strengthening your communication skills, rather than the joy of monologuing, be more interested in others. Learn to genuinely pay attention to what others are saying.In Dale Carnegie’s words, “be a good listener and encourage others to talk about themselves.”   When people feel good as they talk to you, they’ll associate those good feelings with you. That’s a winning formula for making friends and influencing people.ㅇ['Corporate Culture', 'Career', 'Communication', 'Teamwork', 'Videos']

Title: STOP COMPARING! Content: If you need to compare yourself with someone, compare yourself with you. What can you do to improve your life quality? How can you be a better and more loving person? How can you be nicer to yourself than you were yesterday? You are the only person you can compare yourself with.When we focus on other people, we lose time that we could otherwise invest in ourselves. We don’t grow green grass by focusing on our neighbor’s garden, we do it nurturing our own. So, instead of wasting time comparing your path to someone else’s, spend it investing, creating, and caring for your own.You can’t change something you don’t acknowledge. So, instead of resisting or fighting where you are, come to peace with it. Say yes to every part of your life, and from that place, make decisions that will move you in the right direction.If you’re not happy where you are today, remember that this is just a snapshot of your life. Where you are today doesn’t say anything about where you’ll be in one or three years from now. What matters isn’t where you are. What matters is your mindset, attitude, and where you’re going.ㅇ['Motivation & Inspiration', 'Psychology', 'Philosophy', 'Career', 'Mindfulness']

Later he thought it was the cornerstone of psychodynamic therapy."ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Health', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychology', 'Religion & Spirituality']
Title: Loss Of Intimate Relationship: The End Of Meaning Content: By far, the most painful loss, a breakup/divorce robs us of meaning, and we are then unable to feel good ourselves due to the time and energy suddenly left without any meaningful activity.As meaning gets destroyed, a part of our identity goes away, and happiness, which is connected to meaning(and not money, or success), also goes away with it.This feeling of meaninglessness and emptiness results in sadness and also depression.

Title: Telescoping Content: We tend to rely on memory rather than knowledge to date events happening within our lifetime. But as our memory distorts our perception of time, it also affects our sense of when an event took place.Psychologists have found that it’s common when recalling a long-ago event to think that it happened more recently than it did. But if the event happened within the past three years, we often think that it happened longer ago.This effect is called telescoping. Think of it as looking backward or forwards through a telescope where images are distorted depending on the orientation.ㅇ['Religion & Spirituality', 'Mindfulness', 'Health', 'Meditation', 'Science & Nature']
Title:  Content: When my clients want to focus on their goals in therapy, I challenge them to ask this question first: “How do I make decisions every day?” Because if you’re relying on your relationships or the internet for your definition of success, then you’re not bringing very much of yourself — your own thinking, your own values — to whatever you’re trying to accomplish.ㅇ['Psychology', 'Mindfulness', 'Mental Health', 'Meditation', 'Love & Relationships']

Title: Failing to deal with our emotions Content: Behavior choices seldom happen in isolation. Blocking others out can have repercussions on the rest of the family. Others are often affected, as depicted in the scene with Connell and his therapist in Normal People.If we fail to deal with emotions in a healthy way, we may engage in unhealthy ways to help suppress them, such as alcohol, drugs, or over-eating. In turn, it will have physical consequences on the brain and body.ㅇ['Parenting', 'Psychology', 'Mental Health', 'Human Resources', 'Love & Relationships']

Title: The perception of risk Content: The perception of and reaction to risk is often dismissed as emotional. The first thing that happens is you're afraid, and from that fear, you feel risk. So the view of risk is becoming less cognitive while emotion becomes dominant.Emotion is about what might happen, not so much the probability. The more emotional the event is, the less sensible people are.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Economics', 'Leadership & Management']

Title: Coffee brewing Content: In years passed, coffee drinkers didn't know how coffee was produced or brewed. Coffee was cheap, tasted bitter, and was purposed for medicine or fuel. But over the decades, coffee has been elevated to craft level.Filter or drip coffee can taste smooth and sweet like chocolate or taste fruity. The expansion of flavours is partly due to new roasting techniques. Roasting at relatively low temperatures for a shorter time tends to bring out the flavours of the bean itself and where it was grown.ㅇ['Health', 'Personal Development', 'Food']
Title: Spending a bit more money on coffee Content: High-quality coffee is more expensive, and spending a bit more means your coffee is more likely to be ethically produced.Coffee producers have historically been exploited, and even fair trade prices are not always enough. Where possible, buy your coffee from roasters who purchase their beans ethically.ㅇ['Health', 'Personal Development', 'Food']
Title: Drink thoughtfully prepared cups Content: Coffee stays fresh only for a limited time. The person making it must know how to brew it properly.Even the best beans brewed the wrong way can produce a bad cup of coffee.To enjoy coffee, look for places with lots of information about their coffee displayed, and/or staff who can answer your questions about the coffee.To brew at home, you're best off learning how to brew well by hand, using a kettle to boil water and one of the dozens of manual coffee devices available on the market.ㅇ['Health', 'Personal Development', 'Food']

It can be a little time-consuming but it allows your brain to process in the background creating ideas and insights, instead of just storing residual tasks.ㅇ['Remote Work', 'Reading & Writing', 'Productivity', 'Time Management', 'Creativity']
Title: Sell Yourself Content: Your income is also influenced by how well you market yourself. Your employer wants to pay as little as possible for your work while your goal is to be paid what you're worth. To bridge the gap, a smart person will negotiate his salary.Delay salary discussions until after you're offered a job. The same with raises. Discuss a pay increase after your performance review.Always let the employer suggest a salary first.When you hear the offer, repeat the top value, then stop talking.Counter the offer with a researched response. It means you have done your homework before the interview and know a reasonable salary for the position.After you've discussed your salary, negotiate additional benefits like extra vacation days or a company car.ㅇ['Money & Investments', 'Personal Development', 'Career', 'Leadership & Management']

What has been proven?"ㅇ['Strategy', 'Startups', 'Creativity', 'Learning & Education', 'Technology & The Future']
Title: Skills Vs Strengths Content: Skills, like the ability to do math, marketing, programming, or physics, are mainly extrinsic.Strengths, like our being good at grasping information, or in influencing people, are mainly intrinsic.Working on three to four extrinsic skills (to reach the top 25 per cent) is actually just working 10,000 hours towards the main (intrinsic)strength of yours, even if you don’t realize the same.ㅇ['Books', 'Career', 'Personal Development', 'Business', 'Learning & Education']

Title: Step 3: Expected Value Calculation Content: The ideal, practical and effective number of goals is between one and three. More than three goals can mean no particular goal.One can use the expected value calculation to prioritize your goals:Expected Value=Resources Required x ROI x Probability Of Success.Check your goals against this calculation and find out what resources(time, energy, money) are required and what is the probability of its success, depending on factors like your enthusiasm and the likelihood of the project working.ㅇ['Remote Work', 'Habits', 'Productivity', 'Problem Solving', 'Time Management']
Title: Step 4: Then We Prioritize Content: Now that all the ingredients are in place, it is going to be a lot easier to actually prioritize your work.One can use a simple ABCDE method, ranking the tasks as very important, important, so-so important, and those which can be delegated or eliminated.Another way is to use a 2x2 matrix, called the Eisenhower Priority Matrix, essentially a 2D box with four quadrants, slotting the various activities and tasks in our to-do list into their real levels of importance.ㅇ['Remote Work', 'Habits', 'Productivity', 'Problem Solving', 'Time Management']
Title: Better Systems: The Marshall Matrix Content: When there are too many urgent and important tasks, one needs to assign a perceived dollar value to them, and then rank them according to their monetary figures. This method is called the Marshall Matrix.The 80/20 rule says that 20 percent of what we do gets us 80 percent of value, so we need better systems to focus on doing just the 20 percent, getting the best ROI.ㅇ['Remote Work', 'Habits', 'Productivity', 'Problem Solving', 'Time Management']

Title: Pleasure and desire Content: One of the key things in pleasureis that it comes in cycles.The hungry desire state before a meal could produce pleasure from the anticipation of good food. Then, while eating, pleasure dominates, but desire could still come for more salt or a drink until satisfied. If we switch to the desert, we can prolong the pleasure again.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Health', 'Psychology', 'Science & Nature']
Title: Bullying to seem smart Content: A colleague may use their position of authority to demean and dominate others.

No-one may critique her solution. She rolls her eyes when they speak up.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Love & Relationships', 'Teamwork', 'Parenting']
Title: Win Arguments Content: ... without making enemies:Make sure you communicate you are not there to fight (using your tone of voice, for example).Avoid making statements; instead, ask questions.Defend yourself with confidence, but without coming across as antagonistic.ㅇ['Personal Development']
Title: Raising Your Voice Content: When the conversation gets heated, we tend to raise our voices and talk faster. This is a dangerous path because now the ability of both sides to change their minds is close to zero. We dig even deeper into our initial positions and beliefs and no matter how good an argument is, it is not going to be received by the other side.You can sense this happening when people rush to talk over one another.ㅇ['Personal Development']
Title: Asking Questions Content: When having arguments, avoid making statements and use questions instead. These tend to come across as less confrontational. Examples of questions:Genuine questions to better understand the other position.

It can also be practiced while you wait at a train station, or in an elevator lobby.ㅇ['Health', 'Personal Development', 'Time Management', 'Problem Solving', 'Productivity']
Title: A habit of compounding growth Content: Reading is a habit of compounding growth. When reading, you'll learn more, and you'll generate ideas and motivation for making other changes.Reading books means you're getting more concentrated thinking on a topic. It's also harder and requires patience and attention than reading an article for example.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Habits', 'Reading & Writing', 'Motivation & Inspiration']
Title: Put the book down Content: The real cause of reading too few books is that you don't enjoy it enough. Don't feel compelled to finish a book that has become boring, predictable or unhelpful. Start a new one. You can have many books through various states of completion. Some won't be finished, and that's okay. Reading less is worse than having a few go unfinished.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Habits', 'Reading & Writing', 'Motivation & Inspiration']
"Title: Expressing anger Content: ""You have to express your anger to release it"" is a myth. Research shows that expressing your anger only makes it stronger. Turning away from it by doing nothing or distracting yourself leads to less intense anger.Try to address the source of the anger, not the anger itself. For instance, if you're frustrated with your co-worker for being late again with their monthly report, have a respectful and honest conversation to solve the situation."ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Communication', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture', 'Parenting']
Title: Anger feels good Content: Anger makes you feel morally superior.Every time you criticize someone, the implication is that you're better.He’s such an idiot… (but I’m pretty smart).Anger makes you feel in control.It gives you the illusion of control, like you're doing something and making a difference.Anger distracts you temporarily from more painful emotions.This is especially true of men in most cultures for whom anger is a reasonable emotion while fear, sadness, or guilt are not.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Communication', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture', 'Parenting']

Working hard is only a part of the good life. Financial rewards that come from hard labor should be put to use for the sake of leisure.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Time Management', 'Career', 'Philosophy']
Title: Reliant on reputation Content: If you are asked why you believe in, for instance, the big changes in climate, you might answer that:You trust the reputation of scientific research and believe that peer-review is a reasonable way of sifting out 'truths'.You trust newspapers, magazines or TV channels that endorse a political view that supports scientific research to summarise its findings for you.(Here you are twice-removed from the source - you trust other people's trust in science.)Even in conspiracy theories, people trust secondhand information based on the reputation of the sources.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Philosophy', 'Science & Nature']
Title: Empowering your knowledge Content: According to Frederick Hayek's book Law, Legislation and Liberty (1973), 'civilization rests on the fact that we all benefit from knowledge which we do not possess.’In a civilized cyber-world, people must know how to assess critically the reputation of information sources.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Philosophy', 'Science & Nature']
Title: Overeating is a habit Content: Even though your stomach has a hormonal system for telling your brain it is empty, it can also raise your hunger levels at specific times by learned associations, even if you had a large meal.If you repeatedly eat chocolate after dinner when you sit on the couch, your body can start to associate sitting on the couch with eating, and you'll experience a craving.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Personal Development']
Title: Starting wrong eating habits Content: It seems quite easy to acquire desires for certain foods by associations, but more challenging to get rid of them.After only four days of repetition, your body can crave specific foods daily, for instance, chocolate.Any mood, even a positive one, can become a craving trigger, as long as it is consistently followed by food.We eat more when we are socially engaged.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Personal Development']

Title: Luxury Goods Content: Status symbols like diamonds, Lamborghinis, tailor-made suits lose their value if they become cheaper or if too many people own them.They derive their value only in comparison to the average of the group to whom the consumer compares.The same is true when we change our attitudes.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Money & Investments', 'Economics']

"Title: Values and vulnerability Content: Consider the popular virtue of vulnerability. Initially, the message was that vulnerability is not a form of weakness, but a demonstration of strength.It didn't take long for television shows and social media influencers to grab hold of ""vulnerability"" and use it to connect with their audience. Today, vulnerability is almost cliche. It is corrupt and the total opposite of real vulnerability."ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture', 'Economics']
Title: Going to College Content: After at least three generations, it might make more sense to skip going to college.For some, college still makes sense.

Title: Confirmation Bias is not Learning Content: When we only hear opinions that confirm our beliefs, our learning is incremental at best. Like our social media bubble: We read the same sites, listen to the same friends (who agree with us!), and watch the same news over and over, which only confirms what we already believe.

Now, many argue they are healthy.Artificial intelligence, app development, social media management, YouTube content creation, and online course creation barely existed fifteen years ago.Entrepreneurship classes taught to spend hundreds of hours creating in-depth, heavily researched business plans.

Title: Minimalism for the affluent Content: Many people have minimalism forced upon them by circumstance.

Title: The Art of Telling Stories Content: Today, brand perceptions and relationships are increasingly difficult to maintain, due to constraints of limited budgets, a whole lot of options, and audiences who are distracted, disinterested and skeptical.Reciting endless facts and figures cannot hold the audience interest or ensure any recall, as an authentic story can.A story intrigues us, gets us involved and makes our mind communicate silently with the storyteller. It can break through any distractions, change our perception, inspire us, and generate lasting memories.ㅇ['Communication', 'Reading & Writing', 'Problem Solving', 'Marketing & Sales']
Title: Facts Mean Nothing Content: The assumption that the audience will logically look at the facts and figures and make the right choice is fundamentally flawed. Audiences ignore most factual data, which even if repeated often, is forgotten or distorted.ㅇ['Communication', 'Reading & Writing', 'Problem Solving', 'Marketing & Sales']
Title: An Impactful Story Content: Even when brands know the value of communicating through stories, it is hard to create truly powerful narratives.An impactful story usually involves empathetic and authentic people overcoming challenges, which can inspire, entertain and inform audiences.ㅇ['Communication', 'Reading & Writing', 'Problem Solving', 'Marketing & Sales']
"Title: The disease of ""What if"" Content: It’s human nature to linger on feelings of regret. We look back and think that missed opportunities(real or not) could have set us on a different, possibly more rewarding path. Unchecked, these emotions become overwhelming sources of stress and anxiety."ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Mental Health', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychology']
Title: Anti-Social Social Media Content: Studies show that the younger demographic wants restricted, private, secure and exclusive networks which cannot be thronged by unwanted people, like their parents.These exclusive online social places can be termed as digital campfires, and are mainly in the domains of private messaging, micro-communities and shared experiences.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Marketing & Sales', 'Communication']
Title: Private Messaging Campfire Content: Private messaging services like Facebook Messenger and Whatsapp are where private interactions happen and people are comfortable sharing details in private group messaging.There are new applications like Tex-Rex, The Infatuation, or Community which are helping brands penetrate this private space.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Marketing & Sales', 'Communication']
Title: Outside perceptions Content: Posting couple photos and other related social media displays influences other people to see the profile owner as more likable and as more likely to be in a satisfying and committed relationship.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Psychology']
Title: Entertainment and escape Content: Audiences love the chance to feel something, whether it is transformational, funny, sad, or any other emotions.Ask yourself if your talk will help people escape for their daily lives for an hour.ㅇ['Communication', 'Career', 'Personal Development']
Title: A greater sense of community Content: Sometimes you will speak to an audience of people who are all struggling with the same issues.Ask yourself if you are able to create a more connected community with your message.ㅇ['Communication', 'Career', 'Personal Development']
Title: Find the right instructor Content: Set some time aside to see what courses are available.Take advantage of any free lessons, watch the introductions to their classes and see if the instructor will be a good fit for your skill level and speed.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Learning & Education', 'Productivity']
Title: Our Everyday Foods Content: We consume ultra-processed foods every day without even realizing it.The morning cereal and flavored yogurt.The savory snacks and sweet baked goods.The vegan hotdog and the chicken nuggets available on the street.The doughnut or the premium protein bar we buy as a snack.The carton-packed almond milk put in our coffee or the diet coke we have.Apart from obesity, ultra-processed foods are responsible for depression, asthma, heart disease, gastrointestinal disorders, and even cancer.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Marketing & Sales']
Title: More Light On Ultra-Processed Foods Content: Most cooked foods can be termed as 'processed foods', but ultra-processed foods are in a different domain, with few people having the clarity to differentiate.A cooked carrot is processed food, but a bag of industrially-produced, carrot-flavored veggie puffs are ultra-processed and are still aimed at toddlers as a portion of natural food. Other examples include frozen peas or pasteurized milk.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Marketing & Sales']
Title: Staying Clear of Imaginary Groups Content: Out of novelty and boredom, we started being part of 'imaginary' groups just because it is cool to do so. There are groups in social media, or in clubs/bars, in which people join due to desire to be accepted.If we have our friends, family, a career and a few hobbies, we don't need to attach our identity to a group.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Love & Relationships']
Title: Identity-Based Habits Content: Building these habits means focusing on the type of person you wish to become rather than the outcome you wish to achieve. Your current behaviors are simply a reflection of your current identity. To change your behavior for good, you need to start believing new things about yourself.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Habits', 'Problem Solving', 'Health']
Title: Changing your beliefs about yourself Content: Decide the type of person you want to be;Prove it to yourself with small wins;You have to become the type of person you want to be, and that starts with proving your new identity to yourself.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Habits', 'Problem Solving', 'Health']
Title: Reinforce habits Content: Reinforce habits with belief and community.When we tell stories of our own lives of making the desired change, it creates belief. When others chime in, it shows that achieving changes is possible for everyone.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Habits', 'Problem Solving', 'Health']
Title: Uhh... Umm... Content: The 'Uhs' and 'Ums' we naturally utter while speaking, or giving a speech, are generally considered to be a flaw, and a person who makes a lot of these pauses while giving a speech is generally considered weak, nervous, ignorant or sloppy.But these pauses in natural human speech, called disfluencies, may not be a character flaw, but an organic feature of human speech, which is enhancing the listeners' understanding and comprehension.ㅇ['Communication', 'Personal Development', 'Problem Solving']
Title: Know yourself Content: You can only know yourself if you are honest and accepting of all the parts of you.Acknowledge the good parts about yourself.This can include strengths, talents, knowledge, skills.Don't overlook the bad parts. The bad of you will hurt others and sabotage your path toward a meaningful life.There might also be ugly parts, like being awkward, off-putting, or distracting from the good.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Psychology']
Title: Finding your true self Content: People feel a greater sense of meaning in life when they are able to be their true selves. To reveal the true self:Think of only those traits you are able to express around those people you are closest to.Now think of only those characteristics that you possess and are often able to express to others in social settings.The distance between your answer to the true-self and the social settings prompt is how far you have to go to become authentic. Ultimately, the way we act around those who are closest to us is how we should act around everyone.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Motivation & Inspiration', 'Psychology']
Title: Schedule a GYLIO session Content: Ask how and when you're going to attend to the task. Whether you call it 'power hour' or GYLIO, bundle small, unrelated chores together to make the invisible, visible.ㅇ['Time Management', 'Personal Development', 'Productivity', 'Problem Solving']
Title: Innovation Capital Content: There are four factors how innovators build up their innovation capital:Who you are, who you know, what you have done, your ability to draw attention to your ideas.Most notably, innovation capital is something accumulated over time through thoughtful action.The Cybertruck is then about getting attention and proving that Tesla is one of the world's most innovative companies, specifically for the purpose of building Tesla's ability to win support from stakeholders.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Leadership & Management', 'Startups']
Title: Opportunity Cost in Non-financial Situations Content: Opportunity cost in non-financial situations is more difficult to quantify. The loss or gain with choosing an option while foregoing another can be subjective and not readily comparable.Example: While deciding on which job offer to take, we may consider job satisfaction, brand name, commute time, long-term growth, and the salary offered. While finalizing, we have to forego the other best offer. While deciding on a career, we have to consider options like prestige, impact and the work sector.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Money & Investments', 'Personal Development', 'Economics']
Title: Opportunity Cost Calculations Content: Many people and organizations fail to take into account the various opportunity costs.We need to actively question ourselves about the alternatives that may be missed out by deciding on a particular option.The often neglected cost of waiting too long is also a decision that can incur a significant amount of opportunity cost, as we lose the time window to take action, losing the better option due to delay and inaction.Not taking an action is also a decision that needs to be evaluated, just like other options.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Money & Investments', 'Personal Development', 'Economics']
Title: Use Cycles to Make Your Decisions Content: Understanding that we are in a cycle helps us make better decisions.As nothing in life is static, with change being the only consistent attribute, we must respect the cyclic nature of everything, and if we are aware where we are in the up and down motion, we can make better decisions.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Time Management', 'Problem Solving', 'Productivity']
Title: Validation and Boundaries Content: We can try and validate the anger felt by an individual by making them know that their anger is maybe justified while putting firm but respectful boundaries on their aggression.We then need to be clear about what type of aggression we are willing to tolerate, setting boundaries on the unacceptable.We may have to put our foot down and be ready to leave the conversation or escalate the issue, without falling into the trap of guilt and emotion.If possible, we need to restart the conversation when things have cooled down, and diffuse the issue in a calm way.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Love & Relationships', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture']
Title: Avoiding Speculative Self-Talk Content: Unchecked self-talk can easily turn into self-delusion. The stories we create almost always make you look like the good guy and cannot be termed as objective.The way to get out of this speculative self-delusion is to avoid any speculation about other people's anger, at least initially.Make sure to note down the facts of the situation. This can make the story less according to your gut instinct, and more towards the objective reality.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Love & Relationships', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture']
Title: Heuristics during periods of uncertainty Content: During periods of heightened uncertainty, leaders reflexively reduce investment, stop hiring, slash marketing, refrain from entering new markets, or stop making decisions.Although understandable, acting in a pro-cyclical manner can be counterproductive. It can leave companies poorly positioned to benefit from the next stage of the cycle.ㅇ['Corporate Culture', 'Personal Development', 'Leadership & Management', 'Startups']
Title: Investing in the workforce Content: In times of uncertainty, if companies reduce headcount and leave positions open, they can miss out on filling critical needs and areas.Companies must invest in efforts to ensure their workforce has the new skills required by the digital world.Companies should recognize the potential of longtime employees. Their experience and capacity to learn are valuable assets.Companies can build resilience by making their workforce more flexible as some prefer to work on a contingency basis. It means companies have access to needed talent and skills.ㅇ['Corporate Culture', 'Personal Development', 'Leadership & Management', 'Startups']
Title: Adjusting to tax and regulation reform Content: Many organizations have found that volatile shifts in tax and regulation impact their industry, their specific markets and the general environment for business.In order to be resilient, companies must get ahead and work with industry peers and the government to improve outcomes.Companies should embrace technological solutions to help manage compliance issues while they assess the longer-term impact of other changes.ㅇ['Corporate Culture', 'Personal Development', 'Leadership & Management', 'Startups']
Title: Finding meaning above happiness Content: For many people, the pursuit of happiness is the meaning of life itself.However, Friedrich Nietzsche saw the pursuit of happiness as a pointless waste of human life. He was instead dedicated to the idea of finding meaning in life where people are willing to undertake great suffering in the name of a goal they have set.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Philosophy', 'Communication', 'Problem Solving']
"Title: Re-establish a positive emotional tone Content: Raise the issue. ""I know that we are not seeing eye-to-eye on this issue right now, and it is upsetting for both of us, but I'm really optimistic we can work this out."" Suggest a time out or try a brief topic change. Commit to a shared relationship goal. Agree that your relationship is important and that you both want to restore mutual positive feelings. Craft your shared narrative to increase the willingness to forgive and reconcile. Reflect on how both your actions contributed to the failure.  Assume the best about the other person's intentions."ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Communication', 'Teamwork', 'Personal Development', 'Health']
Title: Cynical Readers Content: We have become cynical readers – we read in the disjointed, goal-oriented way that online life encourages & we stop exercising our attention.We read just as much if not more. We live in a text-gorged society in which the most fleeting thought is a thumb-dash away from posterity. It's how we read that changed.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Health', 'Reading & Writing', 'Motivation & Inspiration']

"Title: Children were mostly ""ignored"" Content: For most of human history, children were largely ignored until they were old enough to begin contributing to the survival of household or tribe.It is only in our modern society that children have become the center of attention from day one.Parenting books promise that there are techniques and expertise that parents can acquire to help them accomplish the goal of shaping their children's lives. That this should be a goal is a recent development. Yet, almost every human in history has been raised without the insights of a multitude of parenting books."ㅇ['Parenting', 'Health', 'Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Love & Relationships']
Title: Find Purpose Content: Being neurotic and in a constant state of worry about your problems leads to poor mental health.Doing something for others takes the spotlight off from us, and our stress, anxiety and worries are not highlighted for the time being.Giving our time to helping others selflessly is shown to boost our mental health.ㅇ['Health', 'Mental Health', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Communication']

Title: Large Groups Vs Small Content: A culture created in a two-way relationship or a small group is positive and open because it allows for differences to exist, which are not allowed by large groups in which cultures are attached to your identity.Creating the right kind of culture organically is the magic of a strong relationship, something that is difficult in large groups with a shared ideology.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Communication', 'Teamwork']
Title: Connections and Happiness Content: The idea of a complete and fulfilling life is always related to personal relationships. Happiness, in a way, is the other person. Happiness is our connections, and the relationships we foster, which create and shape us.It's a lost art to cultivate personal relationships without agenda or motive, just connecting and trying to understand and relate to different people.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Communication', 'Teamwork']
Title: What happens during a fast Content: During a fast, the body produces few new proteins and requires cells to take protein from nonessential sources, break them down and use the amino acids to make new proteins, vital for survival. Then, after eating, new proteins are formed in the brain and elsewhere.ㅇ['Health', 'Food']
Title: Aligning the Argument Content: In a disagreement, often certain crucial information isn't available or isn't clearly understood by either person.We need to ask ourselves if:The argument is about something that can be verified.If it matters to you (meaningful).If it is useful.Then we need to make sure that the other person aligns and comes on the same page.ㅇ['Communication', 'Personal Development', 'Love & Relationships', 'Leadership & Management']

Title: Creating Chocolate Content: Cacao (or Cocoa) beans are the seeds that grow in the cacao tree, which are plucked, roasted and separated.The 'nibs' from the beans (part solids and part butter) are ground and made into a paste, which is then again grounded with sugar and some other ingredients.The industrial chocolates include several ingredients like vegetable oils, corn syrup, and artificial vanilla.ㅇ['Health', 'Food']
Title: Bean-To-Bar Content: Authentic chocolate makers are like fine chefs and are obsessed about the texture, character and ethical origins of their beans.Mainstream industrial chocolate makers buy all the beans, good or bad, in bulk, as they are mixing it with so many other ingredients and flavors, that the consumer won't get to know the difference of the beans.ㅇ['Health', 'Food']
Title: Cocoa Percentage Content: Cacao (cocoa) percentage is the quantity of ground-up beans that is present in the chocolate bar.Milk chocolates have 10 to 30 % cacao, while dark chocolates have 35 to 55 %White chocolates generally have 20 % beans(butter only)More cacao doesn't necessarily mean it is more bitter, as cacao butter isn't bitter and has a smooth texture, while cacao solids are bitter.ㅇ['Health', 'Food']

Title: Why storytelling works Content: Stories are like instruction manuals that explain how we move from one state of being to another.Stories help us imagine how we can improve our own lives or avoid unpleasant consequences. Because we can imagine living out the consequences of certain choices, we are often inspired to change our behavior and act in a certain way.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Psychology']
Title: Stories make ideas real Content: The same parts of our brain we use to smell or to wave also help us understand the words we use to describe those experiences.These neurological insights bring much-needed substance to the storytelling conversation.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Psychology']
Title: Accelerating the skilling engine Content: Companies will need to measure the return on their investment in employee skilling.For instance, the cost of giving employees new skills compared to the cost they would have spent on hiring. The expense should include the opportunity cost of waiting to hire.ㅇ['Corporate Culture', 'Career', 'Personal Development', 'Leadership & Management']

Title: A Holistic Approach Content: Accepting that it is ok to make mistakes makes us patient and kind towards ourselves, and keeps us on track with our diet goals, as we understand that our urges to overeat are part of the process.Instead of obsessing over the 'diet' mentality, it is better to focus on your behavioral changes and new habits, incorporating certain activities in your routine. The focus should be on a healthy and holistic lifestyle.ㅇ['Health', 'Food', 'Personal Development']

Title: The 2 Models of Human Development Content: The 'Surrender Yourself' model dials up your levels of happiness as you progress from your basic needs (like food and good health) towards your achievements like recognized success, or creative expression. The pinnacle of this human development model is complete surrender.The 'Fully Human' model is a more subjective way of helping you find your own path. When our most important needs like food, shelter, safety, and stability are met, followed by our need to love, belong and connect with others, we then pursue mastery.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'Communication', 'Love & Relationships']
Title: Self-Care Content: Self-care is often placed in the lonely bottom of our to-do list.We underestimate self-care activities and the impact they have on our lives.Certain practices seem irrelevant (like writing a daily journal to clear your mind) or even self-indulgent(like a long, relaxing bath). The paradox is that the more time you care for yourself, the more generosity, patience and love you have for others.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Health', 'Mindfulness', 'Habits']

Title: Life without work Content: Post-workists, like David Graeber, argue that the absence of work would produce a richer culture. With people having more time, private life could also become more communal like ‘Red Vienna’ in the early 20th century, when the city government built housing estates with communal laundries, workshops, and shared living spaces that were quite luxurious.People might at first be unable to organize their unstructured free time, but our capacity for things other than work can be build up again.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Teamwork', 'Economics', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture']

Title: Effective shaming Content: Shaming can give the weak greater power. It can be used as a tool to encourage structural changes of institutions, organizations, and powerful individuals by exposing a transgressor to public disapproval.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Love & Relationships', 'Health', 'Problem Solving', 'Mindfulness']
Title: Formal punishment should be missing Content: Shaming is most effective when the only possible avenue for punishment would otherwise go ignored. This triggers our sense of fury at injustice.If a nation commits major human rights abuses, it is difficult for another nation to use the law to punish them. Exposing and drawing attention to the violations may shame the nation into stopping.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Love & Relationships', 'Health', 'Problem Solving', 'Mindfulness']
Title: Teaching what you know Content: Research shows that we retain approximately 90% of what we learn when we explain it to someone else or use the new information immediately.Sharing with others what you've learned is one of the most effective ways to learn, and it also tests your knowledge, by assessing your capacity to transfer it to another. This process is called the “retrieval practice”.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Learning & Education', 'Health', 'Problem Solving', 'Habits']

Title: Many feel isolated Content: In a 2018 survey of 20,000 Americans revealed that almost half did not have meaningful in-person social interactions. About the same proportion said they often felt isolated and left out even when others were around.Electronic devices are also interfering with our ability to listen and understand those closest to us. The best way to overcome this is to put down our phones and then actively listen to what they have to say.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Communication', 'Love & Relationships']
Title: The best quality times Content: Driving your children around should not be seen as an inconvenience. It is a moment between moments where you have an opportunity to connect and have fun. It is where you can share and learn things you'd never know otherwise. This is true for other relationships. These in-between moments, in a car, waiting for a delayed plane, allow for conversations that never would have happened otherwise. We get our best times when we look at the moments we have right in front of us.ㅇ['Love & Relationships', 'Personal Development', 'Time Management', 'Communication']
Title: Anarchy Content: Some people would prefer a society without government, where individual freedom comes first.However, a world that promotes anarchy is inherently unstable. Humans continually make new rules to govern and do so as quickly as old rules are overturned.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture']
Title: Cleaning hands Content: Studies show that improving handwashing at 10 of the world’s leading airports could slow the spread of infectious diseases.On average, only 20 percent of people in airports have clean hands - hands washed with soap and water, not just rinsed. The other 80 percent are potentially contaminating everything they touch, from chair armrests, check-in kiosks, security checkpoint trays, and restroom doorknobs and faucets.ㅇ['Health', 'Personal Development', 'Technology & The Future', 'Travel']
Title: Improving handwashing Content: Focussing on the handwashing message at the most significant 10 airports in the world could reduce the spread of disease significantly at a global level (potentiallyby almost 70 percent).Even small improvements in hygiene could make a huge difference. This could potentially be achieved through education, awareness, social-media nudges, public announcements and improved access to handwashing facilities.ㅇ['Health', 'Personal Development', 'Technology & The Future', 'Travel']
Title: Sleep And Exercise Content: While it is well known that sleep and exercise are important, it is equally important to take it easy and not give yourself a hard time.Certain things in life, nature, birds, cats and dogs, are naturally infused with happiness. Even an object like a bicycle is happiness. Find your inner happiness by focusing on what makes you happy.ㅇ['Mindfulness', 'Personal Development']
Title: Ups And Downs Content: Understand that life is cyclic, and ups and downs are a part of our daily existence. Trusting yourself is essential, and if you find there is a problem that you need to address, don't be afraid to seek help. If you feel you are miserable constantly, you can get therapy for an unbiased diagnosis and treatment.ㅇ['Mindfulness', 'Personal Development']
Title: Fresh Take On Religion Content: Modern society has been described as the Age of Noise, and an Organized Lovelessness.Advertising is revealed to be an organized effort to extend and intensify craving.People in the modern age worship progress, technology, and their nation-state, all of which can be described as a 'religion'.The dogma of such religions was profoundly criticized in the classic books, while paving the way towards newer ways to find God, like meditation.The Author and Philosopher's fresh take on religion, shaping it as an 'empirical spirituality' was a huge influence in the 1960s and which has since then led to more people (now 27% in the US) being 'Spiritual but not Religious'ㅇ['Religion & Spirituality', 'Personal Development', 'Philosophy', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture']
Title: Constructing One's Reality Content: Aldous Huxley was heavily criticized after his death by newer philosophers who didn't subscribe to the Perennial Philosophy.While the author insisted that the ultimate mystical experience is the moment of pure oneness with God where the concepts of 'I', language, image and culture are dissolved, his critics argued that all religions are true and some of them are truer than the others.One of the critics states that human beings construct reality using their bodies, rituals, words, actions and cultures.ㅇ['Religion & Spirituality', 'Personal Development', 'Philosophy', 'Society', 'Arts & Culture']
Title: First Principles Thinking Content: We normally use existing methodologies and analogies to solve problems, which is essentially short-cut thinking.Engaging in 'First Principles Thinking' makes us discard existing knowledge, and get down to the essentials, exploring on our own and questioning everything.This uncharted terrain takes us to the absolute truth which we callthe First Principle.When we understand the core of the problem, we can build creative and unique solutions.ㅇ['Problem Solving', 'Personal Development', 'Productivity', 'Business', 'Parenting']
Title: Responding To Craving Content: The usual reaction of resisting or relenting to cravings can be replaced by awareness about the cravingand approaching it withcuriosity.

Early on, this took the form of buying hand sanitizer and rubbing alcohol.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Problem Solving', 'Health', 'Mental Health', 'Leadership & Management']
Title: The bias towards optimism Content: Pleasantries are optimistic things; they insist on seeing the bright side of any situation.A pandemic, however, is not a moment of “I’m fine, thanks.”It is not a moment for the superficially polite. It is a moment to be caring, by discarding some of the traditional politeness. Find linguistic hacks, to emphasize that you don’t want to know how someone is doing in a typical way, but instead in a way that is tailored to this dreadful moment: How are you … considering? How are you doing … with all this?ㅇ['Communication', 'Personal Development', 'Mental Health', 'Health', 'Psychology']

Title: To Persuade or Convince Content: When people disagree with us we assume they are ignorant … that they lack information. So we try to convince them with information.

Title: The power of laughter Content: Humor, in a way, protects us from life's grim reality. We joke because if we didn't, we'd cry.Humor and laughing are also a social vocalization that includes some and excludes others. Jokes establish who is inside the group and who is not.

Title: Contrasting Effects: Attention Residue Content: Contrasting effects, which compare your mundane task to the more enticing and juicy alternatives, make the task even more excruciating and dull.

Title: Difficulties in reaching out Content: There are a lot of reasons talking about our problems can be difficult:We may be educated to internalize feelings, rather than expressing them.The emotions we're dealing with (guilt or shame) can feel so overwhelming that we can’t get up the motivation to talk about them.ㅇ['Health', 'Communication', 'Personal Development', 'Mental Health', 'Love & Relationships']
Title: Rituals play a number of critical roles Content: Rituals in the face of loss can help us feel less grief.Rituals with families can make us feel closer.Rituals with our partners can reinforce our commitment to each other.They are not “elaborate religious ceremonies”, but more often just private and idiosyncratic activities.ㅇ['Personal Development', 'Love & Relationships', 'Time Management', 'Health']

Title: Mindlessness Content: Mindlessness - daydreaming, or getting lost in your own thoughts - is as important as mindfulness.

"Title: The ""8-hour sleep"" myth Content: 8 hours of sleep/night is a useful goal, but it’s not true that everyone needs that.
